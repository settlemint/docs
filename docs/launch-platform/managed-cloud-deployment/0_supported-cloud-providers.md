# Supported cloud providers

When launching a blockchain development project, you need to decide where your project will be stored. SettleMint offers you the flexibility to deploy in the cloud of your choice, and easily build cross-cloud provider and cross-geographical region networks.

Every deployment uses Kubernetes as an orchestration layer for all the different services. Kubernetes is a widely used open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By leveraging managed Kubernetes services by cloud providers, our platform can offer affordable, stable, and scalable environments to run the blockchain nodes and additional services.

SettleMint supports all leading cloud providers.
