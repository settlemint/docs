## Introduction

SettleMint BTP is built to ensure unmatched flexibility through its "Bring Your Own Infrastructure" strategy.

This strategy enables seamless integration of the blockchain transformation platform 'BTP' with your existing infrastructure, covering cloud services, databases, authentication providers, and storage solutions.

It also provides numerous benefits, such as enabling you to specify the high availability and readiness of each component, customize your disaster recovery plan, and implement the platform on familiar, white-labeled components, among others.

After finishing the installation, you will have access to a suite of services and tools designed to support you throughout your blockchain journey. To explore these tools in detail, we invite you to visit our [Developer Hub](/docs/about-settlemint/intro/).

- **Public chains**: Polygon PoS, Polygon zkevm, Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, Hedera _(Internet access required)_
- **Private chains**: Hyperledger Besu, Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric
- **Block Explorers**: Otterscan for Public networks, Blockscout for permissioned
- **Storage**: IPFS, MinIO
- **Integration Tools**: Integration studio, Hasura
- **Integrated IDE**: Including smart contract sets
- **Smart contract Indexer**: The Graph Middleware

It's essential to remember that preparing your infrastructure and necessary services is a [prerequisite](/docs/launch-platform/self-hosted/installing-on-an-existing-cluster/prerequisites/Infrastructure/). Once this foundation is established, you'll need to populate the helm charts values file, as detailed in the subsequent "Platform installation‚Äù section.
