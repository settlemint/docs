# Choosing the Right Support: Partnering for Succes

A thorough understanding of Kubernetes concepts, architecture, and operation is essential. This knowledge is crucial for the effective deployment and management of services within your clusters. Additionally, familiarity with Helm, including chart management and customization, will enable you to leverage its capabilities fully for deploying and maintaining applications on Kubernetes.

Should your team lack the in-house expertise required for managing and maintaining these deployments, we strongly recommend collaboration with one of our certified partners. They are equipped to assist and guide you every step of the way.

Additionally, we have a team of blockchain technology experts ready to support you with any questions or challenges you might encounter.
