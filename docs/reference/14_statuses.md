# Statuses

You can view the status of each service (e.g. network, node, smart contract set, etc.) on the **service's overview page and detail pages**.

## Status list

The following service statuses are defined:

- **Waiting** - The service is waiting to be deployed. This will only take seconds.
- **Deploying** - The service is being deployed. This will only take minutes.
- **Running** - The service is running without any issues.
- **Warning** - The service is still running, but suboptimal as the resources are no longer sufficient.

- **Restarting** - The service is restarting.
- **Deleting** - The service is being deleted.

In relation to the resource usage of your services, specific [resource usage statuses](../using-platform/15_resource-usage.md) are defined.
