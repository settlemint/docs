### Foundry Makefile Tasks

Your Makefile includes several predefined tasks that can be executed to manage and interact with smart contracts using Foundry.

These tasks are designed to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes, enhancing efficiency and productivity in your smart contract development workflow with Foundry. Additionally, you can further customize your Makefile by adding new tasks tailored to your specific needs and project requirements.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each task:

#### **1. `build`**
   - **Purpose**: Compiles the smart contracts using Forge.
   - **Command**: `make build`
   - **Output**: Displays "Building with Forge..." and compiles the contracts.

#### **2. `test`**
   - **Purpose**: Runs tests for your smart contracts to ensure they behave as expected.
   - **Command**: `make test`
   - **Output**: Displays "Testing with Forge..." and executes contract tests.

#### **3. `format`**
   - **Purpose**: Formats the smart contract code to maintain consistency and readability.
   - **Command**: `make format`
   - **Output**: Displays "Formatting with Forge..." and formats the code.

#### **4. `snapshot`**
   - **Purpose**: Creates a gas usage snapshot for the deployed contracts.
   - **Command**: `make snapshot`
   - **Output**: Displays "Creating gas snapshot with Forge..."

#### **5. `anvil`**
   - **Purpose**: Starts an Anvil local Ethereum node, useful for local testing and development.
   - **Command**: `make anvil`
   - **Output**: Displays "Starting Anvil local Ethereum node..."

#### **6. `deploy` and `deploy-anvil`**
   - **Purpose**: Deploys your smart contracts to a specified network or the Anvil local node.
   - **Commands**: `make deploy` for live network, `make deploy-anvil` for Anvil.
   - **Output**: Depending on conditions, displays the deployment process and saves deployment addresses to a file.

#### **7. `script` and `script-anvil`**
   - **Purpose**: Executes deployment scripts after deployment, applicable for further contract interactions.
   - **Commands**: `make script` for live network scripts, `make script-anvil` for Anvil.
   - **Output**: Executes the script and interacts with the deployed contracts.

#### **8. `cast`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a CLI for interacting with the Ethereum VM.
   - **Command**: `make cast SUBCOMMAND=<subcommand>`
   - **Output**: Executes the specified Cast subcommand.

#### **9. `subgraph`**
   - **Purpose**: Deploys a subgraph for the contract, enabling indexing and querying of blockchain data.
   - **Command**: `make subgraph`
   - **Output**: Deploys the subgraph and configures it for a specific contract address.

#### **10. `help`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides help and usage information about the Forge, Anvil, and Cast tools.
   - **Command**: `make help`
   - **Output**: Displays help information for each tool.

### Key Environment Variables

1. **`BPT_SERVICE_TOKEN`**: Authenticates API calls to blockchain services.
2. **`BTP_CLUSTER_MANAGER_URL`**: URL for the cluster manager to configure the Foundry IDE.
3. **`BTP_SCS_ID`**: Identifies the smart contract set in the Foundry IDE.
4. **`ETH_FROM`**: Ethereum address for initiating transactions.
5. **`EXTRA_ARGS`**: Extra arguments for customizing Forge commands.
6. **`BTP_RPC_URL`**: RPC URL for blockchain network connections.
7. **`DEPLOYED_ADDRESS`**: Address of the deployed contract, used in scripts and subgraph tasks.
