# Join a network by invitation

In a permissioned blockchain network (often called a consortium network), participants need to be invited by the network's owner to join the network.

Follow these steps if you received an invitation to join a blockchain network:

1. [Log in](https://console.settlemint.com/) to SettleMint, or [create an account](../launch-platform/managed-cloud-deployment/2_create-an-account.md).
2. Navigate to an existing blockchain application, or create a new one.
3. Click **Blockchain network** in the left navigation.
4. Click **Add a blockchain network**. This will open a form.
5. Choose **Join by invitation code**, and then click **Continue**.
6. Enter the **invitation code** included in the email you received, and click **Confirm**. The network now appears in the overview. Click to see more details of the network.

You can now start [adding nodes to the network](4_add-a-node-to-a-network.md).
