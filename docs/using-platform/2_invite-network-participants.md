# Invite network participants

Permissioned networks, although started by a single organization, allow multiple organizations with a shared business goal to come together and form the consortium. The different organizations transacting with each other in a permissioned network are called **network participants**. The organization who created the network, i.e. the owner, can invite network participants and set specific permissions for the organizations joining the network.

Depending on how you organize your work, you can grow the network with new participants in two ways:

- **Invite an organization** to join the SettleMint platform so they can join the network (e.g. if the organization itself is responsible for adding and managing their nodes)
- **Add an organization** to the network yourself (e.g. if the organization is your client and you are managing the project for them)

## Invite an organization

Navigate to the relevant **application**, and click **Blockchain network** in the left navigation.

Open the **Participants** tab and click **Invite organization**. This opens a form.

Follow these steps to invite an organization to join the SettleMint platform, and join the network:

1. Enter the **email address** of the contact person from the organization you want to invite.
2. Set the **permissions** for this new network participant. You can change these permissions at any time.
3. Optionally, you can add a **message** to be included in the invitation email.
4. Click **Confirm** to go to the list of organizations participating in the network. Your email invitation has now been sent, and you see in the list that it is pending.

The invitation email includes a code that the recipient can use to get access to the network.

## Add an organization

Navigate to the relevant **application**, and click **Blockchain network** in the left navigation.

Open the **Participants** tab and click **Add organization**. This opens a form.

Follow these steps to add an organization to the network yourself:

1. Define the **organization**. You can select an organization you already have in place, or create a new one and choose a name for this new organization. Separate invoices are generated for each organization, so creating a new organization might be more convenient if you need to separate invoices.
2. Enter **billing information** if you created a new organization. SettleMint creates a billing account for this organization. You will be billed monthly for the resources you use within this organization.
3. Define the **application**. You can select an application you already created, or create a new one and choose a name for this new application.
4. Set the **permissions** for this new network participant. You can change these permissions at any time.
5. Click **Confirm** to go to the list of organizations participating in the network. You see the new participant added to the list.

## Manage a network participant

Navigate to the relevant **application**, and click **Blockchain network** in the left navigation.

Open the **Participants** tab and click **Manage participant** to see available actions. You can only perform these actions if you have administrator rights.

**Change permissions** - Changes the network participant's permissions with immediate effect.
