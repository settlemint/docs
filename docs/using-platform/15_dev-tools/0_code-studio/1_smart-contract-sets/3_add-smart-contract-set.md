# Add a Smart Contract Set

By using smart contracts, you can add **business logic** to your application.

Smart contracts are programs that run on the blockchain and define the rules of your use case. They are self-executing with an 'if this, then that' pattern and activate when predefined conditions are met, such as a smart contract that transfers the ownership of a car once a certain amount of money is transferred to the seller's account.

## How to Add a Smart Contract Set

Navigate to the **application** where you want to add the Smart contract set.

Follow these steps to add the Smart contract set:

1. Navigate to **Dev tools** and click on **Add a Dev tool**.
