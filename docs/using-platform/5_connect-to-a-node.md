# Connect to a node

For an application to interact with a blockchain (e.g. by sending transactions/data to the network, or even just by reading data), it must connect to a node.

To connect to a node, you use an endpoint, which is a URL that enables an API to gain access to the node. You interact with the node by sending requests to, and receiving responses from it via an API.

You can find the endpoints on the **node detail page**, in the **Connect tab**, together with node interaction tools with playgrounds for real-time tryouts (e.g. JSON-RPC, GraphQL, etc.).

For protocol-specific information about connecting to a node, refer to the relevant section in the blockchain guides:
