# Challenges Enterprises Face in implementation

Adopting asset tokenization is not as simple as writing a smart contract and
issuing tokens. Companies – especially large enterprises and financial
institutions – encounter a host of technical, operational, and organizational
challenges when implementing blockchain-based tokenization. Below, we detail
some of the key challenges and pain points:

- **Blockchain Scalability & Performance**: Public blockchains like Ethereum
  have historically suffered from limited throughput and high transaction fees
  during peak usage. Ethereum's base layer can handle on the order of ~15
  transactions per second, which is far below the needs of mainstream financial
  markets (which can require thousands of TPS). Although Layer-2 scaling
  solutions and Ethereum 2.0 upgrades are improving capacity, scalability
  remains a concern for enterprise use. High-volume asset tokenization (e.g.,
  trading millions of tokens for a popular stock) could be hindered by network
  congestion or costly gas fees. If transactions slow down or become expensive,
  the advantages of speed and efficiency disappear. Enterprises must consider
  whether to use a permissioned blockchain or sidechain to achieve higher
  throughput for their use case. Designing a scalable architecture (perhaps
  using a consortium chain that can handle more TPS) adds complexity. In
  contrast, traditional systems like Visa or stock exchanges have well-tested
  scaling for throughput but lack blockchain's decentralized benefits. Finding
  the right balance – and ensuring the chosen blockchain can scale as adoption
  grows – is a significant challenge.
- **Interoperability (Blockchain Silos)**: There are numerous blockchain
  networks (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc., and various private
  chains). A token issued on one network is not inherently usable on another
  without special bridges or integration. This fragmentation can be problematic.
  Enterprises fear getting "locked in" to a specific technology or platform.
  They often operate many systems that need to connect with the blockchain
  solution – for example, a bank's internal ledger must reflect token balances,
  or a fund manager's trading system must talk to the blockchain. Currently,
  there is a "lack of interoperability among DLT platforms and between those and
  legacy systems", as noted by the Financial Stability Board. Ensuring that a
  tokenization platform can integrate with existing enterprise software
  (databases, ERP systems, trading terminals) and potentially interoperate with
  other blockchains is non-trivial. Without interoperability, tokenization
  projects could end up as isolated islands, limiting their usefulness. This
  challenge is driving interest in blockchain standards, APIs, and middleware to
  connect on-chain and off-chain worlds.
- **Security Concerns**: While blockchains themselves offer strong security
  guarantees (cryptography, immutability), the surrounding implementation can
  introduce vulnerabilities. Smart contracts, if not carefully audited, may
  contain bugs that attackers can exploit to steal or misallocate tokens.
  Managing private keys for enterprise-scale deployments is also a major
  security responsibility – if keys controlling large tokenized assets are
  compromised, it can be catastrophic. The history of DeFi is replete with
  examples of hacks, and enterprises are rightly cautious. As GARP highlighted,
  regulatory and cyber risks can be higher with tokenized assets than
  traditional assets. Companies need to implement robust cybersecurity
  practices, smart contract audits, and possibly insurance for digital asset
  risks. They must also consider how to handle lost keys or errors (which on a
  blockchain can be irreversible without special provisions). Compared to
  traditional systems where transactions can sometimes be reversed or insurance
  covers losses, blockchain requires a security-first approach at every level
  (application, network, and user). This need for new security expertise and
  measures can be a barrier for organizations.
- **Data Privacy & Confidentiality**: Enterprises often deal with sensitive
  information – customer identities, transaction details, trade secrets – which
  they cannot expose on a public ledger. However, most public blockchains are
  fully transparent, meaning anyone can see transaction data. This conflict
  raises privacy concerns that have slowed some RWA adoption. For example, a
  bank issuing a tokenized bond might not want competitors to know exactly who
  bought how much. Similarly, regulatory compliance like GDPR in the EU requires
  careful handling of personal data (if an individual's holdings are on-chain).
  Options to address this include using permissioned blockchains (where data is
  shared only among approved nodes), or employing privacy-preserving techniques
  (zero-knowledge proofs, confidential transactions) on public chains. Each
  approach has trade-offs in complexity and trust. Even on permissioned chains,
  ensuring that data is only visible to the right parties and that the network
  remains secure is a challenge. Privacy addons (like Baseline Protocol or
  Nightfall on Ethereum) are still maturing. Thus, integrating strong privacy
  without sacrificing the benefits of blockchain is a tightrope that enterprises
  must walk. Many early adopters choose private EVM chains to keep data in a
  closed environment.
- **On-Chain/Off-Chain Integration**: Tokenization of real assets invariably
  involves linking the digital token to off-chain reality. This could mean
  integration with databases, IoT devices, or legal processes. For example, if
  you tokenize a real estate asset, you need a mechanism to update the token
  state if the physical property is sold outside the platform or damaged, etc.
  This often requires oracles or trusted data feeds to inform the smart
  contracts of off-chain events (like an appraisal value, or a default event for
  a tokenized loan). Reliable off-chain data is essential to ensure the
  integrity of tokenized assets. Oracles themselves introduce another layer of
  trust and vulnerability – if an oracle feeds incorrect data (whether through
  error or hack), it can trigger wrong outcomes on-chain. Additionally,
  enterprise IT systems (accounting, CRM, risk management) need to pull data
  from the blockchain to keep records in sync. Building these integrations
  (through APIs, middleware, oracles) is a technical challenge that requires
  specialized knowledge. It's not as simple as plugging into an SQL database.
  This "last mile" connection between blockchain and the real world is often one
  of the most complex aspects of a tokenization project.
- **Organizational and Cultural Resistance**: Beyond tech issues, companies face
  internal organizational hurdles when introducing blockchain. There can be a
  lack of understanding or even distrust of the technology among executives and
  stakeholders. Key decision-makers might be wary of the hype and concerned
  about regulatory crackdowns, leading to reluctance in committing resources.
  Additionally, implementing tokenization might disrupt existing workflows and
  the roles of certain intermediaries, leading to internal pushback or fear of
  job redundancy. Financial factors also play a role – the cost and ROI of
  implementing blockchain is uncertain, which may cause management to hesitate.
  In surveys, executives often cite regulatory concerns as the top barrier to
  blockchain adoption (e.g., 39% in a Deloitte survey said regulatory issues
  were the biggest obstacle). This indicates that even if the technology is
  ready, organizations may stall projects until they feel the legal environment
  is safe. Moreover, there is a talent gap – blockchain expertise is in high
  demand and short supply, so enterprises may struggle to find or train people
  who can build and maintain these systems. All these factors contribute to an
  inherent resistance to change, making it challenging to move pilot projects
  into full production.
- **Legacy Systems and Process Overhaul**: Large enterprises have complex legacy
  systems that are deeply ingrained in their operations. Introducing blockchain
  might require significant changes or parallel systems. For instance, if a bank
  tokenizes an asset, how does that interact with its core banking system, its
  settlement processes, its reporting to regulators? Often, adopting blockchain
  isn't just plug-and-play – it may require re-engineering business processes to
  realize the benefits. This is time-consuming and costly. Companies also worry
  about vendor lock-in and long-term support: choosing a blockchain platform is
  a bit like choosing a new operating system for your operations – a wrong
  choice could be expensive to undo. Thus, many enterprises conduct lengthy
  proof-of-concepts and sandbox trials, which can delay implementation and
  dampen momentum.

In summary, enterprises must overcome a combination of **technical hurdles**
(scalability, integration, security, privacy) and **organizational challenges**
(skills, culture, regulatory clarity) to successfully implement asset
tokenization. Each of these challenges can be addressed – for example, by using
more scalable networks, employing middleware, enforcing rigorous security
audits, etc. – but doing so requires expertise and the right tools. This is
where platforms like SettleMint come into play, by providing solutions to ease
these pain points. The next section will discuss how SettleMint's asset
tokenization starter kit and platform help tackle the above challenges,
simplifying the journey for organizations adopting blockchain tokenization.
