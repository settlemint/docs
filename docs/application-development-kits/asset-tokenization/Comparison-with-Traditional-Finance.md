# Comparison with Traditional Finance

Asset tokenization represents a fundamentally new approach to managing and
transacting assets, and it offers several advantages over traditional asset
management and securities issuance processes. At the same time, it comes with
its own drawbacks and challenges when compared to the status quo. Below is a
comparison of the key benefits and disadvantages:

## Advantages of Tokenization (vs. Traditional Systems)

- **Fractional Ownership & Accessibility**: Tokenization enables assets to be
  divided into much smaller units than traditional finance typically allows.
  This fractional ownership lowers investment minimums and opens up assets to a
  wider pool of investors. For example, someone can invest $100 in a tokenized
  commercial building, which would be impossible in a normal real estate deal.
  This makes investments more accessible and democratizes wealth creation
  opportunities. As one industry source notes, tokenization enables fractional
  ownership – making investments more accessible – while increasing transparency
  and reducing transaction costs. By contrast, traditional asset ownership often
  requires large capital (e.g., buying an entire property or meeting high fund
  minimums).
- **Improved Liquidity**: By turning assets into digital tokens that can be
  traded on exchanges (24/7, globally), tokenization can inject liquidity into
  markets that are otherwise illiquid. Assets like real estate, fine art, or
  private equity stakes, which normally take weeks or months to sell (if buyers
  can be found at all), could potentially be traded in minutes on a blockchain
  marketplace. Greater liquidity can unlock value for asset owners (who can sell
  tokens as needed) and provide investors with easier exit opportunities. In
  traditional settings, such liquidity either doesn't exist or comes with heavy
  discounts and slow OTC transactions.
- **Efficiency & Speed (Faster Settlement)**: Blockchain transactions settle
  much faster than traditional financial trades. The use of smart contracts and
  a shared ledger can automate trade clearing and settlement, moving the cycle
  from T+2 days to near T+0 (instantaneous) in many cases. This reduces
  counterparty risk and frees up capital that would be tied in pending
  settlements. Additionally, tokenization can streamline processes by reducing
  intermediaries – for example, corporate actions like dividend payments or
  coupon payments can be automated by smart contracts, and transfers don't
  require paperwork or manual reconciliation. Markets become faster and
  potentially operate 24/7, unlike traditional markets constrained by business
  hours and cut-off times.
- **Transparency & Immutable Records**: Transactions and ownership records on
  public blockchains are transparent and tamper-evident. Every token transfer is
  recorded on the ledger, creating an audit trail that regulators and
  participants can verify in real time. This level of transparency can reduce
  fraud and enhance trust. For instance, an investor in a tokenized fund can
  independently verify the total token supply and wallet addresses holding the
  tokens, which is harder to fake than traditional paper share registers.
  Tokenization adds transparency to transactions, letting participants know who
  owns what and under what rights, via an immutable record. Such openness
  contrasts with opaque traditional systems where investors rely on
  intermediaries for reporting.
- **Global Reach & 24/7 Markets**: A token on a public blockchain can be
  accessed by anyone with an internet connection (subject to compliance checks
  for regulated tokens). This global investor pool means issuers can reach a
  wider audience without the friction of cross-border intermediaries. Moreover,
  blockchain markets operate continuously. Investors can trade tokenized assets
  outside of normal exchange hours, which provides flexibility and may lead to
  better price discovery as information is reflected in prices more quickly.
  Traditional assets often trade on specific exchanges with limited hours and
  geographic silos.
- **Programmability & Innovation**: Perhaps one of the greatest advantages is
  the programmability of tokens via smart contracts. This allows for automated
  enforcement of rules and innovative features that are hard to replicate
  off-chain. For example, a token can have built-in compliance (rejecting
  transfers that don't meet KYC/whitelist criteria), automatic dividend
  distribution to holders, or governance rights (token holder voting) coded
  directly into it. It also enables "Composable finance" – tokens can interact
  with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, staking, etc.,
  unlocking new use cases. In traditional finance, enforcing such rules requires
  complex legal agreements and manual processing; on blockchain, they execute
  automatically, lowering operational overhead. This automation can make
  financial markets cheaper and more accessible, potentially "unlocking
  trillions" in value by removing inefficiencies

In summary, tokenization can make asset management and issuance **faster,
cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive** than traditional methods. It
offers benefits akin to the efficiencies brought by dematerialization of
securities in the past, but with even greater potential due to fractionalization
and smart contract automation.

## Disadvantages & Considerations of Tokenization

- **Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance**: One of the biggest hurdles is the
  uncertain regulatory environment. Many jurisdictions have not fully adapted
  securities laws to accommodate blockchain tokens. As a result, tokenized asset
  offerings must navigate a complex patchwork of regulations, often treating
  tokens as securities with all associated compliance requirements (e.g.,
  registration or exemption, KYC/AML for investors, etc.). Even then, there's a
  risk that ownership of a tokenized asset may not be legally recognized or
  enforceable in court if regulations aren't aligned ￼. For example, holding a
  token that represents a share in a building is only valuable if the law
  recognizes that token as conveying ownership of the building; otherwise, legal
  title might still need a traditional paper deed. This uncertainty can deter
  investors and institutions. Traditional systems, while slower, operate in
  well-established legal frameworks with clear investor protections and dispute
  resolution mechanisms.
- **Higher Cybersecurity and Technical Risks**: Tokenization introduces new
  attack surfaces and technical risks that traditional assets don't face. Smart
  contract vulnerabilities or hacks of token platforms can lead to losses of the
  underlying asset value. In recent years, there have been numerous hacks of
  smart contracts in the crypto space, some resulting in tens or hundreds of
  millions in losses. "Hacks on smart contracts, the backbone of tokenized
  assets, have already led to major financial losses." ￼. Additionally, managing
  cryptographic private keys (which control the tokens) is critical – if an
  investor loses their keys or if a custodian is compromised, the tokens can be
  irretrievable. These cyber risks are generally higher with tokenized assets
  than with traditional assets held in custody by a bank or transfer agent ￼.
  Traditional finance certainly has fraud and cyber risks, but the introduction
  of complex tech (smart contract code, wallets, bridges) adds new failure modes
  unique to blockchain.
- **Volatility and Market Fragmentation**: If tokenized assets trade on crypto
  exchanges or platforms with less oversight, they might experience higher price
  volatility, partly due to the broader crypto market sentiment. For instance, a
  tokenized bond could theoretically swing in price if there's a crypto market
  downturn, even if the underlying bond cash flows are stable – unless
  sufficient arbitrage mechanisms exist. Additionally, because tokenization is
  new, markets can be fragmented across different platforms and standards. A
  tokenized asset might not have a single deep exchange for trading, leading to
  liquidity being split or limited. Traditional markets, while siloed by
  geography, tend to concentrate liquidity on major exchanges or OTC desks under
  frameworks that have evolved over decades.
- **Custody and Control Issues**: With fractional, tokenized ownership, the
  original asset is often held by a custodian or special purpose vehicle on
  behalf of token holders. This introduces counterparty risk – investors must
  trust that the issuer or custodian truly holds the underlying asset and will
  act in the token holders' interest. If the issuer defaults or the custodian
  mismanages the asset, token holders could be left with worthless tokens. In
  contrast, owning a traditional asset (like a stock via a brokerage) comes with
  legal recourse and clearer regulatory oversight of custodians. Furthermore,
  tokenization can mean shared ownership control. For example, tokenizing a
  property means multiple parties have ownership stakes; this could complicate
  decisions about the property (unless governance is clearly established via
  smart contracts or off-chain agreements). Finextra aptly noted the "risk of
  shared ownership" – owners may lose some direct control over their asset once
  it's tokenized and held by many parties.
- **Privacy Concerns**: The transparency of public blockchains, while a benefit,
  can also be a drawback for certain use cases. Many institutions and investors
  are not comfortable with transaction details and holdings being visible to
  everyone. Blockchain's transparency, while an advantage, may raise privacy
  concerns ￼ – for instance, a competitor could observe how much of a certain
  asset a company has tokenized or an individual's investment activities.
  Traditional systems keep such information private (only regulators and
  involved parties have access). This is one reason some enterprises opt for
  private/consortium blockchains or privacy-preserving techniques when
  tokenizing, to ensure sensitive data (like investor identities, trade sizes,
  etc.) aren't exposed to the world.
- **Market Infrastructure and Acceptance**: Tokenized assets still lack the
  robust market infrastructure that traditional assets enjoy. There are limited
  regulated exchanges for security tokens, and mainstream institutional
  investors often have mandates or internal rules preventing them from holding
  digital assets. Additionally, service providers like auditors, fund
  administrators, and banks are still adapting to handle blockchain-based
  assets. There's a "continuing shortage of infrastructure and talent" in the
  tokenization space (as McKinsey observed) which slows adoption ￼. By contrast,
  traditional asset management has a mature ecosystem of exchanges, brokers,
  custodians, and clear legal frameworks.

In summary, while tokenization offers compelling benefits, it also faces
**non-trivial disadvantages** compared to traditional methods: unclear
regulation (leading to legal risk), new technical/cyber risks, potential privacy
issues, and the need to build trust and infrastructure from the ground up. These
challenges must be carefully managed for tokenization to achieve its potential.
The next section delves deeper into the technical and organizational challenges
enterprises encounter when implementing tokenization projects.
