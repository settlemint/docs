## Market Size: Rapid Growth to Trillions

The asset tokenization market is expanding quickly from a modest base to a
multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. As of 2023, the total value of tokenized
real-world assets (RWAs) is estimated around $185 billion – a figure dominated
(~95%) by fiat-backed stablecoins (tokens pegged to currencies). Excluding
cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, tokenized assets today still represent only a
tiny fraction of global asset values. However, numerous analyses project
explosive growth by 2030:

- [McKinsey & Co.](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/from-ripples-to-waves-the-transformational-power-of-tokenizing-assets#:~:text=Tokenized%20financial%20assets%3A%20From%20pilot,excluding%20cryptocurrencies%20and)
  estimates a tokenized market capitalization of about $2–3 trillion by 2030 (in
  a base case).
- A joint
  [BCG/ADDX report](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/tokenized-assets-the-transformational-power-of-tokenizing-assets.aspx)
  forecasts $16.1 trillion by 2030, roughly 10% of global GDP, as a conservative
  case. This represents a 50-fold increase from ~$310B in 2022.
- A
  [Chainlink research report](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chainlink-predicts-tokenized-asset-market-will-reach-16t-by-2030/#:~:text=Chainlink%20predicts%20tokenized%20asset%20market,Right%20now)
  projects tokenized assets could surge to $10–16 trillion by 2030, comprising
  5–10% of all assets.
- In more bullish scenarios, industry analysts foresee even larger outcomes. For
  example, Security Token Market (STM) predicts up to $30 trillion in tokenized
  assets by 2030 in an
  [optimistic scenario](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/07/rwa-tokenization-is-going-to-trillions-much-faster-than-you-think#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20from%20Security,real%20estate%2C%20bonds%20and%20gold).
  (Even a
  [midpoint estimate](https://cryptoslate.com/bis-urges-caution-as-finance-industry-embraces-asset-tokenization/#:~:text=BIS%20urges%20caution%20as%20finance,As%20the%20push)
  of ~$10 trillion would be a massive jump from today's ~$0.2 trillion).

Despite different projections, the consensus is that tokenization will grow into
the multi-trillions within this decade, fueled by increasing institutional
adoption and regulatory clarity.

## Sector Breakdown

Tokenization is poised to impact a broad range of asset classes, with certain
sectors leading the charge:

- **Real Estate**: Real estate is often cited as the single largest segment for
  tokenized assets in coming years. By 2030, real estate is
  [expected](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/30384890/kenson-investments-pioneers-real-world-asset-integration-into-defi-ecosystems#:~:text=,As)
  to account for nearly one-third of the tokenized asset market – making it the
  largest category. This reflects the huge value of global property markets and
  the appeal of fractional real estate investing.

- **Equities (Stocks)**: Public and private equities are projected to be a major
  driver as well. The
  [STM report](https://www.securitytokenmarket.com/tokenization-report-2024/)
  noted that by 2030, tokenization will be led by stocks, along with real
  estate, bonds, and gold. In other words, equities could become one of the
  dominant tokenized asset classes, as traditional shares are turned into
  security tokens that trade on blockchain-based systems.

- **Bonds**: Debt markets are beginning to adopt tokenization through digital
  bond issuances. The market for tokenized bonds is expected to grow from under
  $1 billion today to roughly
  [$1 trillion by 2030](https://www.globalxetfs.com/tokenization-of-financial-assets-spurs-a-wave-of-blockchain-experimentation/#:~:text=Tokenization%20of%20Financial%20Assets%20Spurs,%C2%B7%20The%20tokenization%20of).
  Government and corporate bonds issued as tokens can potentially reduce
  settlement times and broaden investor access.

- **Investment Funds**: Tokenized investment funds are emerging as a significant
  category.
  [Boston Consulting Group analysts predict](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/tokenized-assets-the-transformational-power-of-tokenizing-assets.aspx)
  that tokenized funds (e.g. tokenized mutual funds or private funds) could
  reach about 1% of global AUM by 2030 (~$600 billion). This "third revolution
  in asset management" mirrors the rise of ETFs in making funds more accessible.

- **Commodities**: Physical commodities like precious metals are being tokenized
  to enable 24/7 digital trading. Gold tokens are a prime example – as of 2023,
  popular tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and PAX Gold (PAXG) have market
  capitalizations of
  [~$700 million and $600 million respectively](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether-gold/#:~:text=Tether%20Gold%20price%20today%2C%20XAUt,supply%20is),
  totaling over $1.3 billion in tokenized gold. Beyond gold, tokens for other
  commodities (e.g. silver, oil, diamonds) are nascent but anticipated to grow
  as platforms for commodity-backed tokens develop.

- **Other Real-World Assets**: The "RWA" category in crypto often includes
  assets like fiat currency (stablecoins), real estate, commodities, and more.
  Currently, fiat-backed stablecoins are by far the
  [largest RWA segment](https://www.binaryx.com/blog/investing-in-tokenized-real-world-assets-rwa-from-stablecoins-to-real-estate#:~:text=Investing%20in%20Tokenized%20Real%20World,RWA%20space%2C%20we%20can)
  (~$170B), but as noted above, real estate is expected to take the lead
  by 2030. Tokenized art, collectibles, and intellectual property also fall
  under RWAs (albeit smaller in value).

In summary, tokenization's market size is poised to expand dramatically.
Estimates for 2030 range from a few trillion dollars in conservative analyses up
to $10–30+ trillion in more aggressive outlooks. Real estate is projected to be
the largest single asset type (≈30% share), followed by equities, bonds, and
commodities like gold. The fund management sector could see hundreds of billions
tokenized. Even if only a fraction of these forecasts materialize, asset
tokenization will represent a multi-trillion dollar market within the next
decade.
