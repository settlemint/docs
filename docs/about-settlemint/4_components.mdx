This guide will explain each of the tools and services on SettleMint and how they connected to
build a blockchain application.

## The Blockchain Application

/>
The first step to building anything on SettleMint is to [create an application](../../using-platform/create-an-application).
You can think of an application as the collection of resources that you need to build
your blockchain application. This includes a blockchain network, smart contracts,
middleware, storage, and integrations.{' '}

## Add a Blockchain Network and Node

<img
  src={blockchainNetwork}
  alt="Blockchain Network and Node"
  width="70%"
  height="70%"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
After creating a blockchain application, you now need to [add a blockchain network](../../using-platform/add-a-network-to-an-application)
and node to your application. SettleMint offeres a variety of different [blockchain
networks](../supported-blockchains) to choose from whatever your usecase may be.
Networks need nodes to support the blockchain to run, once a [network is created](../../using-platform/add-a-node-to-a-network/)
then a node is also added automatically.{' '}

## Create a Smart Contract

<img
  src={smartContract}
  alt="Add a Smart Contract"
  width="70%"
  height="70%"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Smart Contracts allow us to run code on the blockchain. Developing a smart contract
by [adding a smart contract set](../../using-platform/add_smart_contract_sets/create_smart_contract_set),
is an important step to reaching the business and product goals of your blockchain
application.

## Add a Middleware

<img
  src={middleware}
  alt="Middleware"
  width="70%"
  height="70%"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Blockchain applications produce data that lives on the blockchain, but we need to
be able to access that data in order to use it. Creating a [middleware](../../using-platform/middleware/)
allows us SettleMint currently offers two middleware services: The Graph and Smart
Contract Portal Middleware.{' '}

## Add Storage

<img
  src={storage}
  alt="Storage"
  width="70%"
  height="70%"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Your blockchain application may need to store data. Blockchains are good for running
different processes in a decentralized way but can be costly to store large amounts
of data. SettleMint offers [two storage options](../../using-platform/storage/):
IPFS (decentralized) and MinIO (centralized) S3 storage.

## Add an Integration

<img
  src={storage}
  alt="Integration"
  width="70%"
  height="70%"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Blockchains are not the only technology that your blockchain application may need
to interact with. SettleMint offers an [Integration Studio](../../using-platform/integration-studio)
which allows you connect your blockchain application to other technologies such as
databases, APIs, and more. This tool is a low-code to which also offers a visualization
of any business logic included in your integration.

## Add a Custom Deployment


Your blockchain application may require custom components or frontend applications that are not provided by the standard SettleMint platform offerings. The [Custom Deployment](../../using-platform/custom-deployment/) feature allows you to deploy your own Docker images on the SettleMint platform. This provides the flexibility to integrate custom solutions, such as frontend applications, within your blockchain-based projects, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of your application.

## Getting Started

Now that you have a better idea of each of the components that make up SettleMint, try deploying
your first application with our [Hello World Guide](../../launch-platform/managed-cloud-deployment/quickstart/).
