# SettleMint Components

This guide will explain each of the tools and services on SettleMint and how they connect to build a blockchain application.

## The Blockchain Application

The first step to building anything on SettleMint is to [create an application](../../using-platform/create-an-application). You can think of an application as the collection of resources that you need to build your blockchain application. This includes a blockchain network, smart contracts, middleware, storage, integrations, and insights.

## Add a Blockchain Network and Node

After creating a blockchain application, you now need to [add a blockchain network](../../using-platform/add-a-network-to-an-application) and node to your application. SettleMint offers a variety of different [blockchain networks](../supported-blockchains) to choose from whatever your usecase may be.

## Create a Smart Contract

## Add a Middleware

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Blockchain applications produce data that lives on the blockchain, but we need
to be able to access that data in order to use it. Creating a
[middleware](../../using-platform/middleware/) allows us to do so. SettleMint
currently offers three middleware services: The Graph, Smart Contract Portal
Middleware and Firefly Fabconnect.

## Add Storage

  alt="Storage"

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Your blockchain application may need to store data. Blockchains are good for
running different processes in a decentralized way but can be costly to store
large amounts of data. SettleMint offers [two storage
options](../../using-platform/storage/): IPFS (decentralized) and MinIO
(centralized) S3 storage.

## Add an Integration

  alt="Integration"

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
Blockchains are not the only technology that your blockchain application may
need to interact with. SettleMint offers an [Integration
Studio](../../using-platform/integration-studio) which allows you connect your
blockchain application to other technologies such as databases, APIs, and more.
This tool is a low-code to which also offers a visualization of any business
logic included in your integration.

## Add a Custom Deployment

Your blockchain application may require custom components or frontend applications that are not provided by the standard SettleMint platform offerings. The [Custom Deployment](../../using-platform/custom-deployment/) feature allows you to deploy your own Docker images on the SettleMint platform. This provides the flexibility to integrate custom solutions, such as frontend applications, within your blockchain-based projects, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of your application.
