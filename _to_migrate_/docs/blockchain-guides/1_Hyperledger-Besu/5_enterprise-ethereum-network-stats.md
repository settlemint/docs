# Network and node stats

## Network stats

The dashboard gives you an overview of the following stats for the network:

### Best block

Shows the "heaviest" block in terms of cumulative difficulty. In other words, the latest block number of the longest valid chain.

### Last block

Shows the time, in seconds, since the last block was mined. This value is a good indicator of whether the network is still up and running. A value noticeably above the average time between blocks indicates that the network is no longer mining blocks.

### Average block time

Shows the average time, in seconds, it takes for the network to mine a new block.

### Nodes

Shows the number of nodes in this network.

### Transactions/5m

Shows the number of transactions in a 5-minute window, displayed for the last hour.

### Gas usage/5m

Shows the amount of gas spent in a 5-minute window, displayed for the last hour.
