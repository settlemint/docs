  How to rebrand and enhance the front-end interface of the application
---

The **SettleMint asset tokenization kit (ATK)** is a modular open-source
platform that enables fast deployment of asset tokenization solutions. While it
includes infrastructure and smart contract templates, the frontend DApp—built
with **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**—serves as the primary interface for users and
clients. The soruce code is available on GitHub - [SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit on GitHub](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit)

Smart contract templates (under `kit/contracts/`) and Helm-based infrastructure
charts (under `kit/charts/`) are available, but this document will focus on the
frontend (`kit/dapp/`) only.
<br></br>

The APIs exposed by the SettleMint Asset Tokenization Kit are designed to be
developer-friendly, REST-compliant, and suitable for seamless integration with
both modern web applications and legacy enterprise systems. These endpoints
cover a wide range of functionality including asset issuance, role management,
token transfers, transaction monitoring, yield scheduling, and user account
control. Each API is authenticated via an x-api-key header, using the
application-level access token, which ensures secure and controlled access to
the backend services.
<br></br>

Developers can use these APIs to extend the current frontend or create entirely
new modules and views. These APIs are also ideal for external integrations with third-party systems.
Whether you’re connecting the platform to an ERP system, investor onboarding
portal, custodial wallet service, or regulatory reporting system, the exposed
endpoints provide the necessary flexibility. Legacy frontends or enterprise
tools can call these APIs directly to query asset metadata, initiate token
actions (e.g., mint, redeem, burn), or enforce access control based on
organizational workflows.
<br></br>

In UI-driven customizations, you can build new React components in the
src/components/ directory that consume these APIs to render data-rich views such
as investor summaries, issuance pipelines, fund performance breakdowns, or
compliance logs. With consistent schema definitions available through the
/api/swagger endpoint, developers can easily generate client libraries or use
tools like Postman and Swagger UI for rapid prototyping.

## Project structure overview

The frontend application is located inside the following path:

kit/dapp/

The core source files reside in the `src/` directory, which is organized as
follows:

| Folder            | Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app/`        | Route-based pages and views                                      |
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI blocks like asset displays, login cards, and widgets |
| `src/hooks/`      | React hooks for business logic (wallets, data fetching, etc.)    |
| `src/lib/`        | Shared libraries and service clients                             |
| `src/utils/`      | Utility functions used across the app                            |
| `src/types/`      | TypeScript types and interfaces                                  |
| `src/i18n/`       | Translatable message files for multi-language support            |
| `public/`         | Static assets, logos, and background images                      |

## Understanding the frontend stack

The frontend stack is built using modern JavaScript tools:

- **Next.js** for routing, page rendering, and performance optimization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and theming
- **TypeScript** for strong typing across components and logic
- **React hooks** to abstract state management and user flows
- **Headless modular architecture** that makes the kit adaptable to new use
  cases

---

## Component-based UI customization

The core of the customization effort will revolve around modifying or replacing
components located in:

kit/dapp/src/components/

### Example components:

- `asset-info`: Displays asset metadata like class, valuation, issuer
- `asset-status-pill`: Shows colored status labels for active, expired, or
  upcoming assets
- `auth`: Handles wallet login and user authentication flows
- `layout`: Base page layout including navigation, theming, and background
  visuals

### How to customize:

- Replace text labels or buttons with domain-specific terminology (e.g., "Carbon
  credits" instead of "Assets")
- Modify visual hierarchy using Tailwind utility classes (`text-lg`,
  `bg-blue-200`, etc.)
- Replace logos and color palettes using your organization's design tokens
- Introduce new UI elements like KPI cards, charts, or asset filtering widgets

You can also **introduce new components** by following the same conventions and
placing them in the same directory with self-contained logic and style.

---

## Routing and views

All page-level routes and user workflows are managed inside:

kit/dapp/src/app/

This is where you'll add or update views for actions like:

- Viewing asset lists
- Tokenizing new assets
- Dashboard analytics
- User KYC status or permission management

Each folder in `app/` represents a route and includes components and logic
specific to that page. For example, to create a new route `/reports`, you would
create a folder `src/app/reports/` and define the page structure using standard
Next.js conventions.

---

## Logic and hooks

Hooks abstract key logic into reusable functions and live in:

kit/dapp/src/hooks/

These include:

- `useWallet()`: Connect and manage wallet state
- `useAssets()`: Fetch and format asset metadata
- `usePermissions()`: Handle access roles and conditional UI behavior

You may add your own hooks to encapsulate logic like integrating third-party
APIs (e.g., for KYC, ESG scoring, legal docs, etc.).

---

## Theming and branding

You can change the **visual branding** of the app by modifying:

### Global styles:

- Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Colors, font sizes, border radius, spacing

### Backgrounds and logos:

- Replace files in:

kit/dapp/public/backgrounds/ kit/dapp/public/logo.svg

- Update layout components to reference your assets

### Dark/light themes:

- Theming is handled by Tailwind and can be adjusted using conditional CSS
  classes (`dark:bg-gray-800`, `light:text-black`, etc.)

---

## Language & text customization

Multi-language support is implemented using message files in:

kit/dapp/src/i18n/

Each locale file (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`) contains key-value pairs for
interface text. This makes it easy to:

- Translate the platform for different regions
- Customize the tone of language (corporate vs. casual)
- Handle jurisdiction-specific legal disclaimers

---

## Utilities, types, and libraries

Supporting folders for maintaining consistent and scalable architecture:

- `src/utils/`: Reusable utility functions (e.g., formatting, validators)
- `src/types/`: TypeScript types for API responses, asset metadata, user models
- `src/lib/`: External service clients (e.g., subgraph queries, REST API
  fetchers)

These folders help keep business logic clean and reusable across your
customizations.

## Running locally

To preview and test your changes:

```bash
cd kit/dapp
bun install
bun dev
```
