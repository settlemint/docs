first user to signup gets the admin rights to the application.

The user is required to create a secure 6-digit PIN. This PIN is used to
authorize all wallet-related transactions and ensures that only the legitimate
wallet holder can perform actions such as transferring assets or interacting
with contracts.

After setting the PIN, the system generates a list of one-time-use recovery
codes. These codes allow the user to verify transactions or recover wallet
access in case of credential loss. The interface prompts the user to store these
codes securely, such as in a password manager or offline backup. These codes are
not retrievable after this step.

Post login you will see the dashboard and will get access to various modules and
services related to asset tokenization.
