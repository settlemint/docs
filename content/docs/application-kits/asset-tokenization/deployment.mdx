  - **"Contract deployment failed"**: Check wallet has sufficient gas
  - **"Subgraph sync error"**: Verify contract addresses match
  - **"Type generation failed"**: Ensure contracts compiled successfully
</Callout>

### How do I customize the database schema?

The Asset Tokenization Kit uses a flexible database architecture that can be extended for your specific needs:

#### Common Database Customizations

**Adding Custom Fields**:
- KYC/AML data (verification levels, documents)
- Business-specific metadata (credit scores, collateral details)
- Regulatory fields (tax IDs, jurisdiction data)
- Integration IDs (ERP references, banking details)

#### Database Modification Process

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Modify Schema** üìù
    ```bash
    # Navigate to database schema
    cd kit/dapp/src/lib/db
    
    # Edit schema files with your custom fields
    # Example: Add accreditation status to users
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Apply Schema Changes** üîÑ
    ```bash
    cd kit/dapp
    bun db:push                    # Update database structure
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Register with GraphQL** üîó
    ```bash
    settlemint hasura track -a     # Track new tables/columns
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Regenerate Types** üèóÔ∏è
    ```bash
    bun codegen --force           # Update TypeScript definitions
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test Changes** ‚úÖ
    ```bash
    bun dev                       # Verify in development
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Authentication Schema Customization

**Extending User Profiles**:

When modifying authentication-related tables (user, session, account, verification):

1. Update `additionalFields` in `kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts`:
   ```typescript
   additionalFields: {
     accreditedInvestor: boolean,
     kycLevel: 'none' | 'basic' | 'enhanced',
     jurisdiction: string,
   }
   ```

2. Clear browser cookies and re-authenticate to see changes

3. Reference: [Better Auth Core Schema](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#core-schema)

<Callout type="info" title="Best Practices">
  - Always backup database before schema changes
  - Test migrations in development first
  - Document custom fields for team members
  - Plan for data migration in production
</Callout>

#### Production Database Considerations
