Select the network you will like to use and then on the next step, decide if you
will be deploying development or production environment. Optionally, enable code
studio to get access to smart contract and front end UI IDE within the platform
UI.

For local development, please go to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit) and
follow the readme setup guide.

There are two ways to use this kit:

1. **Predeployed Setup** - Using pre-deployed contracts (fastest)
2. **Customized Setup** - Deploy your own contracts

### Predeployed Setup (Fastest)

This is the fastest way to get started with the kit. It uses pre-deployed
contracts, subgraphs, and ABIs.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Login and connect to SettleMint
bunx settlemint login
bunx settlemint connect

# Generate types and start development server
cd kit/dapp
bun codegen:settlemint
bun addresses
bun dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the
application. Create an account by clicking "Sign up" - the first account created
will have admin privileges.

### Customized Setup

If you want to deploy and use your customised contracts, subgraph, and ABIs,
follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

1. Forge v0.3.0 - Install the latest Foundry from
   [https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
2. Node.js version >=20.18.1 - Required for The Graph CLI. We recommend using
   [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node.js installation.

#### Deployment Steps

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Login and connect to SettleMint
bun settlemint login
bun settlemint connect

# Deploy contracts
cd kit/contracts
bun deploy:remote

# Deploy subgraph
cd ../subgraph
bun deploy:remote
cd ../../

# Codegen
bun codegen

# Setup dapp
cd kit/dapp
bun addresses
bun db:push

# Start development server
bun dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the
application. Create an account by clicking "Sign up" - the first account created
will have admin privileges.

### Database Customization

To modify database schema:

1. Update your schema definitions in the schema folder:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to schema directory
   cd kit/dapp/src/lib/db
   ```

2. Apply your changes to the database:

   ```bash
   # Run in the kit/dapp directory
   cd kit/dapp
   bun db:push
   ```

3. Ensure your updates are registered with Hasura by executing:

   ```bash
   settlemint hasura track -a
   ```

4. Regenerate GraphQL types by running the following command in the root
   directory. It is important to use the `--force` flag to ensure the types are
   regenerated:

   ```bash
   bun codegen --force
   ```

5. Launch the application to verify your changes:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

> **Note**: When modifying tables managed by Better Auth (user, session,
> account, verification), you may need to update `additionalFields` in
> `kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts`. If user object field changes aren't reflected
> in the `useSession` hook, try clearing cookies and signing in again. See
> [Better Auth database core schema](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#core-schema)
