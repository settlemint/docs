Select the network you will like to use and then on the next step, decide if you
will be deploying development or production environment. Optionally, enable code
studio to get access to smart contract and front end UI IDE within the platform
UI.

You can choose between development and production environments based on the
stage and requirements of your application.

<br></br>
The development environment operates on a shared infrastructure within
SettleMint’s managed SaaS offering. It is provisioned with a small resource
pack, suitable for prototyping, testing, and early-stage development. This
environment includes one validator node and one non-validator node, sufficient
for basic functionality validation and integration testing.
<br></br>
The production environment, on the other hand, is deployed on a dedicated
cluster and is provisioned with a medium resource pack by default. It is
designed to support high availability, performance, and scalability for
enterprise-grade deployments. The production setup includes four validator nodes
and two non-validator nodes, ensuring fault tolerance and improved network
consensus performance.
<br></br>
Both environments support dynamic resource scaling, allowing resource packs to
be scaled up or down at any point based on application demand or usage patterns.

## Custom deployment module for front end deployment

The **Asset Tokenization Kit (ATK) Frontend UI** is a containerized web
application that provides a user interface for interacting with tokenized assets
on the SettleMint platform. This guide covers the configuration and deployment
of the frontend UI as a **custom deployment** within SettleMint.

### **Container Image Setup**

The ATK Frontend UI is deployed using a prebuilt container image. Configure the
following:

| Field                                 | Description                                                 | Example Value                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Container Image**                   | The Docker image containing the frontend UI.                | `ghcr.io/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit:0.3.14` |
| **Exposed Port**                      | The port on which the frontend serves HTTP traffic.         | `3000`                                             |
| **Registry Credentials** (if private) | Username and access token for private container registries. | (Provided by DevOps)                               |

### **Access Control**

Define who can access the deployed frontend:

- **Anyone with the link** – Public access (suitable for demos).
- **Members of the organization** – Restricted to authenticated users within the
  SettleMint organization.

### **Environment Variables**

The frontend requires the following environment variables to connect to backend
services:

| Variable                                  | Purpose                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `SETTLEMINT_INSTANCE`                     | Internal SettleMint instance identifier.        |
| `SETTLEMINT_ACCESS_TOKEN`                 | Authentication token for SettleMint APIs.       |
| `SETTLEMINT_HD_PRIVATE_KEY`               | Private key for blockchain transaction signing. |
| `SETTLEMINT_BLOCKSCOUT_UI_ENDPOINT`       | URL for the blockchain explorer (Blockscout).   |
| `SETTLEMINT_HASURA_ENDPOINT`              | Hasura GraphQL engine endpoint.                 |
| `SETTLEMINT_HASURA_DATABASE_URL`          | Database connection URL (internal).             |
| `SETTLEMINT_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET`          | Admin secret for Hasura access.                 |
| `SETTLEMINT_PORTAL_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`      | SettleMint Portal GraphQL API endpoint.         |
| `SETTLEMINT_THEGRAPH_SUBGRAPHS_ENDPOINTS` | The Graph indexing service endpoints.           |

**Security Note:**

- Sensitive values (e.g., `HD_PRIVATE_KEY`, `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET`) are masked in
  the UI.
- Rotate credentials periodically following security best practices.

### **Custom Domains (Optional)**

For production or client-facing deployments, bind a custom domain: e.g.
https://demo.tokenmint.be/ This ensures a branded URL for end users.

<br></br>

The **Asset Tokenization Kit Frontend UI** can be deployed as a standalone
service while maintaining integration with SettleMint's blockchain and backend
infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Independent frontend management** – Deploy UI updates without affecting
  other components.
- **Flexible access control** – Configure visibility for internal testing or
  public demos.
- **Secure environment injection** – Sensitive keys and endpoints are securely
  passed at runtime.
- **Custom domain support** – Use branded URLs for professional deployments.

## Local development

For local development, please go to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/settlemint/asset-tokenization-kit) and
follow the readme setup guide.

There are two ways to use this kit:

1. **Predeployed Setup** - Using pre-deployed contracts (fastest)
2. **Customized Setup** - Deploy your own contracts

### Predeployed Setup (Fastest)

This is the fastest way to get started with the kit. It uses pre-deployed
contracts, subgraphs, and ABIs.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Login and connect to SettleMint
bunx settlemint login
bunx settlemint connect

# Generate types and start development server
cd kit/dapp
bun codegen:settlemint
bun addresses
bun dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the
application. Create an account by clicking "Sign up" - the first account created
will have admin privileges.

### Customized Setup

If you want to deploy and use your customised contracts, subgraph, and ABIs,
follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

1. Forge v0.3.0 - Install the latest Foundry from
   [https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
2. Node.js version >=20.18.1 - Required for The Graph CLI. We recommend using
   [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node.js installation.

#### Deployment Steps

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Login and connect to SettleMint
bun settlemint login
bun settlemint connect

# Deploy contracts
cd kit/contracts
bun deploy:remote

# Deploy subgraph
cd ../subgraph
bun deploy:remote
cd ../../

# Codegen
bun codegen

# Setup dapp
cd kit/dapp
bun addresses
bun db:push

# Start development server
bun dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the
application. Create an account by clicking "Sign up" - the first account created
will have admin privileges.

### Database Customization

To modify database schema:

1. Update your schema definitions in the schema folder:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to schema directory
   cd kit/dapp/src/lib/db
   ```

2. Apply your changes to the database:

   ```bash
   # Run in the kit/dapp directory
   cd kit/dapp
   bun db:push
   ```

3. Ensure your updates are registered with Hasura by executing:

   ```bash
   settlemint hasura track -a
   ```

4. Regenerate GraphQL types by running the following command in the root
   directory. It is important to use the `--force` flag to ensure the types are
   regenerated:

   ```bash
   bun codegen --force
   ```

5. Launch the application to verify your changes:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

> **Note**: When modifying tables managed by Better Auth (user, session,
> account, verification), you may need to update `additionalFields` in
> `kit/dapp/src/lib/auth/auth.ts`. If user object field changes aren't reflected
> in the `useSession` hook, try clearing cookies and signing in again. See
> [Better Auth database core schema](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#core-schema)
