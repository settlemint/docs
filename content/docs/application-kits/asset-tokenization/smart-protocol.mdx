## What is SettleMint's SMART Protocol?

SMART **(SettleMint Adaptable Regulated Token)** Protocol is an advanced, modular
smart contract framework designed and developed by SettleMint for creating regulatory-compliant security
tokens and tokenizing real-world assets. Built as a derivation of ERC-3643 with
ERC-20 foundations using OpenZeppelin, it provides a complete infrastructure
for:

- **Security Token Issuance**: ERC-3643 derived and ERC-20 compliant tokens for
  regulated financial instruments
- **Asset Tokenization**: Bonds, equity shares, deposits, funds, and stablecoins
- **Advanced Identity Management**: On-chain KYC/AML compliance with ERC-734/735
  identities and **logical expressions** for complex verification rules
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Modular compliance rules for different
  jurisdictions
- **DeFi Integration**: Full ERC-20 compatibility for seamless ecosystem
  integration

### Key Highlights of SMART

- **ERC20 Compliance**: Fully implements `ERC20` and `ERC20Upgradeable`,
  ensuring compatibility with Ethereum tooling and DeFi ecosystems.
- **Externally Modular Architecture**: SMART uses composable extensions (e.g.,
  `SMARTBurnable`, `SMARTCollateral`) in a plug-and-play model.
- **Token-Configurable Compliance**: SMART tokens can be configured to use
  specific modular rules and parameters without needing custom compliance
  contracts.
- **Token-Agnostic Identity Verification**: Identity registry remains reusable
  across tokens and use cases—tokens dynamically pass required claim topics into
  the verification logic.
- **Authorization Agnostic**: SMART is compatible with any authorization logic
  via hooks (e.g., OpenZeppelin `AccessControl`).
- **ERC-2771 Meta-Transaction Support**: Compatible with trusted forwarders for
  gasless transactions and improved UX.
- **Upgradeable & Non-Upgradeable Support**: SMART supports both upgradeable
  (proxy-based) and fixed (non-upgradeable) token deployments—giving issuers
  full control over token mutability.
- **KYC is optional**: SMART supports both regulated and unregulated assets.
  Tokens can opt into identity verification (KYC/AML) or operate
  permissionlessly—ideal for both security tokens and cryptocurrencies.
- **Built-in ERC-165 Interface Detection**: Every SMART token implements
  ERC-165, allowing external systems to query which capabilities (burnable,
  redeemable, etc.) a token supports—improving composability and tooling.
- **Two-Step Identity Recovery Flow**: If a user loses access to their wallet,
  recovery happens in two stages: first, a new identity is registered for the
  new wallet via the Identity Registry (by a manager) and the relationship is
  tracked; then, the user reclaims tokens from the lost wallet after the token
  validates the recovery with the Identity Registry—offering secure and
  structured recovery.

## Architecture Overview

SMART Protocol consists of three main layers:

### 1. **Token Layer** - Smart contract tokens with configurable compliance

### 2. **Compliance Layer** - Orchestration engine with modular rules

### 3. **Identity Layer** - On-chain identity management and verification

**Key Insight**: The compliance contract acts as an orchestration engine,
executing different modules based on each token's configuration. This allows
multiple tokens to share the same compliance infrastructure while having
completely different compliance requirements.

### Overview

The diagram shows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Token Layer**
  - Multiple tokens can exist independently
  - Each token defines its own compliance requirements
  - Tokens use the shared compliance contract for orchestration

- **Compliance Contract**
  - Single orchestration engine shared by all tokens
  - Executes compliance checks based on token-specific configuration
    - Routes requests to appropriate modules

- **Module Layer**
  - Shared compliance modules with global configuration
  - Each module can be used by multiple tokens with different parameters
  - Modules contain both global settings and token-specific configuration

### Compliance Contract

Orchestrates compliance checks as an engine based on token configuration:

- Executes modules configured on each specific token
- Performs pre-transfer validation using token's module list
- Updates post-transfer state for configured modules
- No modules stored directly - purely orchestration engine

### Compliance Modules

The SMART protocol provides a flexible, extensible compliance module system with
both default modules and support for custom implementations. The system supports
country restrictions, identity verification with logical expressions, transfer
limits, time-based restrictions, and more.


Key highlights:

- **Advanced Identity Verification**: Complex logical expressions beyond simple
  AND-only requirements
- **Flexible Configuration**: Global infrastructure with per-token parameters
- **Modular Architecture**: Mix and match modules based on regulatory
  requirements
- **Extensible Framework**: Create custom modules for specific compliance needs

Available module categories:

- **Country-based**: Allow/block lists for jurisdictions
- **Identity-based**: Verification, allow/block lists for identities and
  addresses
- **Transfer & Supply**: Token supply limits, investor count restrictions
- **Time-based**: Lock-up periods, holding requirements

```

### Identity Registry

Central registry mapping wallet addresses to identity contracts. Features:

- Stores identity contract addresses for each wallet
- Manages identity verification status
- Handles wallet recovery mechanisms
- Supports identity transfers

### Trusted Issuers Registry

Manages trusted entities that can issue identity claims:

- Stores trusted issuer addresses
- Maps issuers to claim topics they can attest
- Supports multiple issuers per topic

### Topic Scheme Registry

Defines the claim topics available for compliance:

- Lists valid claim topics globally
- Maps topics to verification requirements
- Shared registry across all tokens

### 2 step recovery mechanism

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LostWallet
    participant NewWallet
    participant IdentityRegistry
    participant Identity
    participant Token
    participant Admin

    Note over LostWallet: Wallet Lost/Compromised

    NewWallet->>Admin: Request Recovery with New Identity
    Admin->>Admin: Verify User Identity

    %% Step 1: Identity Recovery - User specifies new identity
    Admin->>IdentityRegistry: initiateRecovery(lostWallet, newWallet, newIdentity)
    IdentityRegistry->>IdentityRegistry: Track wallet relationship (old -> new)
    IdentityRegistry->>IdentityRegistry: Register newWallet with newIdentity
    IdentityRegistry->>IdentityRegistry: Store recovery mapping for token reclaim

    %% Step 2: Token Recovery (if needed)
    Admin->>Token: recover(lostWallet, newWallet)
    Token->>IdentityRegistry: isRecoveryAllowed(lostWallet, newWallet)
    IdentityRegistry-->>Token: Recovery permitted
    Token->>Token: Transfer Balance

    Note over NewWallet: Recovery Complete with New Identity
    Note over IdentityRegistry: Wallet relationship tracked for token reclaim
```

## Complete System Flow

Now that we've covered all three layers, here's how they work together during a
token transfer:

### Token Transfer Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Token
    participant Compliance
    participant IdentityModule
    participant IdentityRegistry
    participant Identity
    participant TrustedIssuers
    participant TopicScheme
    participant Module1
    participant ModuleN

    User->>Token: transfer(to, amount)

    %% Compliance Check (including identity verification)
    Token->>Compliance: canTransfer(from, to, amount)

    loop For each module
        Compliance->>IdentityModule: canTransfer(token, from, to, amount, params)

        %% Identity verification within module (only checks recipient)
        IdentityModule->>IdentityRegistry: isVerified(to, logicalExpression)
        IdentityRegistry->>TopicScheme: hasTopicScheme(topic)
        TopicScheme-->>IdentityRegistry: topic valid
        IdentityRegistry->>TrustedIssuers: getTrustedIssuersForClaimTopic(topic)
        TrustedIssuers-->>IdentityRegistry: trusted issuers list
        IdentityRegistry->>Identity: getClaim(claimId)
        Identity-->>IdentityRegistry: claim data
        IdentityRegistry->>TrustedIssuers: isClaimValid(identity, topic, signature, data)
        TrustedIssuers-->>IdentityRegistry: claim validity
        IdentityRegistry-->>IdentityModule: verification result

        IdentityModule-->>Compliance: true/false

        Compliance->>Module1: canTransfer(token, from, to, amount, params)
        Module1-->>Compliance: true/false
        Compliance->>ModuleN: canTransfer(token, from, to, amount, params)
        ModuleN-->>Compliance: true/false
    end

    Compliance-->>Token: compliance result

    alt Transfer Allowed
        Token->>Token: _transfer(from, to, amount)
        Token->>Compliance: transferred(from, to, amount)

        loop Update each module
            Compliance->>IdentityModule: transferred(from, to, amount)
            Compliance->>Module1: transferred(from, to, amount)
            Compliance->>ModuleN: transferred(from, to, amount)
        end

        Token-->>User: Transfer Success
    else Transfer Blocked
        Token-->>User: Revert with reason
    end
```

### Transfer Validation Steps

1. **Identity Verification**
   - Verify receiver has valid identity contract and required claims
   - Sender verification is assumed (already owns tokens, so was previously
     verified)

2. **Compliance Validation**
   - Compliance engine runs through modules configured on the specific token
   - Each configured module performs its specific checks
   - All configured modules must approve for transfer to proceed

3. **Balance Updates**
   - Execute standard ERC-20 transfer
   - Update compliance module states
   - Emit transfer events

SMART tokenization protocol from SettleMint rethinks the ERC-3643 architecture by moving modularity, configuration,
and verification closer to the token layer. This creates a more flexible,
reusable, and standards-compliant framework for compliant token issuance in
dynamic regulatory environments. By decoupling identity and compliance logic
from any single token, SMART improves scalability and opens doors for broader
cross-application identity use.
