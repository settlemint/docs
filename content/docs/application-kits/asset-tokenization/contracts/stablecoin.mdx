Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being
backed by real-world assets or reserves. They offer the advantages of digital
assets—such as speed, transparency, and programmability—while avoiding price

enterprises, banks, and financial institutions secure methods for transactions,
settlements, and asset management. They facilitate real-time payments,
streamline international remittances, reduce transactional friction, and
significantly improve settlement efficiency.
