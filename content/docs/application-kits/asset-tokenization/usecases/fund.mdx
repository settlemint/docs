Tokenizing a fund means representing investor ownership (fund shares or units)
as digital tokens on a blockchain. This modernizes fund administration and
investor interactions, leading to greater efficiency and transparency. Use cases
for financial institutions include:

- **Automated Fund Distribution**: Distributions of profits or dividends from a
  fund to investors can be automated via smart contracts. When a tokenized fund
  earns income (e.g., interest, rent, or exits from investments), the smart
  contract can instantly calculate each investor’s share and pay it out in
  digital currency or reinvest according to preset options. This removes delays
  in manual calculations and wire transfers – once the fund’s accounts are
  settled, investors receive their due almost immediately. Blockchain-based
  funds have demonstrated automated dividend distribution, with tokens
  seamlessly transferring value to holders without human intervention. The
  result is timely payments, lower administrative costs, and increased trust
  from investors who see transparency in how and when distributions occur.
- **Investor Governance & Engagement**: A tokenized fund can also issue
  governance tokens or use its security tokens to let investors vote on certain
  decisions (much like shareholders in a company). For example, limited partners
  in a digital fund might vote on extending the fund’s life or on approving
  significant asset purchases, all through a secure on-chain voting process.
  This capability gives investors a more direct voice and can be especially
  useful in alternative investment funds, where investors often negotiate for
  advisory committee rights. By conducting these votes via blockchain, outcomes
  are instantly recorded and verifiable, and the process is accessible to global
  investors without coordinating physical meetings. This democratic and
  transparent approach can make a fund more attractive to investors who value
  influence and insight into their investments.
- **Real-Time Auditing and Reporting**: Tokenized fund platforms provide
  real-time auditability of fund transactions and holdings. Every contribution,
  redemption, trade, or valuation event can be logged on the blockchain,
  creating an immutable history of the fund’s operations. Fund auditors and
  regulators can be granted permissioned access to this ledger, allowing them to
  verify NAV (Net Asset Value) calculations or asset custody in near real time.
  This continuous audit trail reduces the time and cost of traditional fund
  audits, which often involve sampling and reconciling records from multiple
  parties. It also enhances security by making it very difficult to conceal
  improper transactions – any movement of assets is recorded and visible.
  Overall, this transparency strengthens compliance as fund managers can
  demonstrate adherence to investment mandates and restrictions at all times.
- **Streamlined Compliance & Administration**: Many administrative tasks in fund
  management can be automated or simplified with tokenization. Investor
  onboarding (KYC/AML checks) can be integrated such that only verified
  investors can hold the fund tokens, and any transfer triggers compliance
  checks programmatically. This can lead to huge efficiency gains – industry
  research indicates tokenization can “streamline, automate, and simplify most
  stages” of alternative investment management. Smart contracts can automate
  capital calls (notifying investors and updating their contributions when new
  capital is needed), as well as fee calculations (management and performance
  fees can be calculated in real time based on asset values on-chain). By
  reducing manual processes, funds cut down on errors and labor costs. One
  outcome is that fund managers may accept a larger number of investors (even
  with smaller tickets), since servicing them is less burdensome – thus
  unlocking more capital while still maintaining regulatory compliance through
  built-in rules.
- **Institutional-Grade Asset Management**: Tokenized funds are designed to meet
  the needs of institutional investors in terms of security and regulatory
  framework. The tokens representing fund units are treated as securities,
  falling under existing legal regimes, but with improved technological
  resilience. For example, using a distributed ledger means there’s no single
  point of failure in maintaining ownership records – this adds robustness to
  investor record-keeping and disaster recovery. Furthermore, using
  well-established blockchain standards (like Ethereum’s ERC-20 or ERC-1400 for
  security tokens) ensures compatibility with custodians and wallets that
  institutions trust. Banks can custody these digital fund tokens in secure
  wallets (with multi-signature or MPC security) similar to how they custody
  traditional securities. The end result is a fund that offers cutting-edge
  features (instant settlement of subscriptions/redemptions, granular ownership,
  global reach) without compromising on the safety, oversight, and trust that
  institutional clients demand.
