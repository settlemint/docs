Stablecoins are digital tokens fully backed by fiat currency reserves, providing
price stability. Banks use them on permissioned blockchains to streamline
payments and settlements while meeting regulatory standards. Key use cases
include:

- **Real-Time Interbank Settlement**: Banks can use stablecoins for 24/7
  interbank settlements, enabling instant, on-chain transfer of funds between
  institutions. This drastically cuts settlement times from days to seconds and
  reduces reliance on traditional networks like SWIFT. For cross-border
  payments, a stablecoin (fully backed by reserves) can serve as a bridge
  currency to achieve near-instant finality with lower counterparty risk. Faster
  settlement improves liquidity and lowers operational costs per transaction.
- **Institutional Payment Networks**: Consortia of banks can establish
  stablecoin-based payment networks for large-scale institutional payments. For
  example, Fnality’s Utility Settlement Coin (USC) is a bank-backed stablecoin
  that promises near-instant cross-bank payments with reduced counterparty risk.
  Such a network, running on a permissioned blockchain, provides a secure,
  regulated platform for settling high-value transactions (like loan
  syndications or trade finance) in seconds. All participants undergo KYC, and
  the stablecoin’s 1:1 backing with central bank funds ensures stability and
  regulatory compliance.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Auditability**: Every stablecoin transaction is
  recorded on an immutable ledger, creating a transparent audit trail. Banks can
  simplify compliance by using analytic tools on the blockchain to monitor
  transactions in real time and ensure they meet AML/KYC requirements. The clear
  history of token transfers is advantageous for compliance audits, giving
  regulators confidence that funds are fully collateralized and tracked. This
  transparency reduces reconciliation effort and speeds up reporting, helping
  institutions maintain strict oversight of funds.
- **Programmable Payment Solutions**: Stablecoins enable programmable money for
  institutional use. Banks can embed smart contracts that trigger payments or
  escrow conditions automatically, improving efficiency and security in complex
  transactions. For instance, a corporate payment could be programmed to release
  from escrow once goods are delivered. With stablecoins, banks can engage with
  decentralized finance protocols in a controlled way – e.g. automating interest
  payments or corporate actions – all on a secure, bank-approved network. This
  level of automation reduces administrative overhead and operational risk in
  payment processing.
