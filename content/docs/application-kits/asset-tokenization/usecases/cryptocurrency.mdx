Beyond stablecoins, banks can develop or utilize digital currencies (not
necessarily pegged 1:1 to fiat) for specific purposes. These customizable tokens
can be designed with particular features (e.g. programmed supply, rules for
usage) to serve institutional goals. Key use cases include:

- **Cross-Border Remittances**: Banks can offer faster and cheaper international
  remittance services by leveraging cryptocurrency networks. Instead of using a
  chain of correspondent banks (which is slow and fee-laden), a bank can convert
  fiat to a digital currency and send it directly to a partner institution
  abroad for conversion to local fiat. This crypto rail can settle transfers in
  minutes at a fraction of the cost – transactions on blockchain can clear for
  under $0.01, dramatically cheaper than traditional payment networks. By
  reducing fees and delays, banks not only save costs but also make remittances
  more accessible, supporting financial inclusion for migrant workers and others
  sending money home.
- **Programmable Treasury Management**: Large organizations and banks themselves
  can use a programmable digital currency for treasury operations. For example,
  a bank-issued token could be used by a corporate client to automate supplier
  payments: funds are held in escrow as tokens and released via smart contract
  once goods are delivered. Citi’s own trials showed that using tokenized cash,
  a corporate treasury was able to “initiate and program instant payments and
  liquidity movement” between its accounts, eliminating friction from cutoff
  times. This kind of programmable treasury service transforms cash management
  into a real-time, responsive operation, reducing manual workflows and errors.
  It also enhances security by ensuring funds move only when predefined
  conditions (verified on-chain) are met.
- **Financial Inclusion Initiatives**: Custom digital currencies can be used by
  banks or NGOs to provide banking services to unbanked populations. For
  instance, a bank might issue a stable-value crypto token that people in remote
  areas can hold and transact via mobile phones, without needing a traditional
  bank account. Because crypto transactions are low-cost and can be as small as
  a few cents, this enables viable micro-payments and micro-savings programs.
  Stablecoins and CBDC-like tokens, if well-designed and regulated, could be
  used widely as a means of payment, helping include the 1.7 billion adults
  currently outside the financial system. By lowering barriers (no minimum
  balance, negligible fees), banks can extend services to new customer segments
  while maintaining control over issuance and compliance.
- **Cross-Currency Settlement Bridge**: An institutional cryptocurrency can
  serve as a bridge asset for FX transactions. In this model, Bank A can convert
  Currency X into a digital token and instantly transfer it to Bank B, which
  redeems it into Currency Y – effectively performing X→Y conversion via a
  token. This streamlines foreign exchange by bypassing multiple intermediaries.
  The World Bank has noted that such an intermediate crypto step in cross-border
  payments allows greater efficiency in conversions. By settling FX trades
  on-chain, banks reduce exchange settlement risk and can offer better rates to
  customers. These custom FX tokens could even be programmed to carry FX hedging
  contracts or to self-destruct after the transaction, adding safety and
  control.
- **DeFi Integration for Institutional Yield**: With proper safeguards, banks
  can deploy custom digital currencies to access decentralized finance
  opportunities. For instance, an institution could create a tokenized dollar
  (with strict whitelisting) that can be used in approved liquidity pools or
  lending platforms to earn yield on excess cash. This opens up new revenue
  streams – the bank’s programmable token could interact only with vetted smart
  contracts, ensuring security and compliance while still benefiting from DeFi’s
  efficiencies. Such use cases are exploratory but illustrate how a custom
  crypto asset lets banks dip into innovative financial markets (like automated
  market making or tokenized asset lending) under controlled conditions. The
  result is potentially higher returns on reserves or new product offerings for
  clients, achieved in a secure, compliant manner.
