Tokenized bonds are digital representations of fixed-income securities issued
and managed on a blockchain. They allow automation of the bond lifecycle, from
issuance to trading to maturity, with enhanced transparency. Key use cases
include:

- **Automated Bond Issuance & Servicing:** Banks can run bond issuance on
  blockchain platforms, automating the workflow of creating and distributing new
  bonds to investors. Smart contracts handle tasks like investor whitelisting,
  subscription processing, and token issuance, reducing manual paperwork and
  underwriting costs. Once issued, the bond’s terms (coupon rate, maturity date,
  etc.) are encoded in the token contract, so interest (coupon) payments and
  principal redemptions execute automatically on schedule. This automation has
  led to significant efficiency gains – for example, one platform saw coupon
  payment processing become 92% faster – and ensures investors are paid on time
  without human error.
- **Faster Settlement & Reduced Counterparty Risk:** In secondary market
  trading, tokenized bonds settle almost instantly via atomic
  delivery-versus-payment. This means a trade either clears in full or not at
  all, eliminating the risk of one party failing to deliver. Immediate (T+0)
  settlement contrasts with the traditional T+2 days cycle, freeing up capital
  and reducing systemic risk from pending trades. HSBC’s tokenized bond pilot,
  for instance, achieved a 90% reduction in settlement times and a 65% decrease
  in operational costs by using blockchain. Faster settlement also means lower
  collateral requirements and improved liquidity for bond trading desks.
- **Enhanced Secondary Market Liquidity:** Digital bonds enable fractional
  ownership and wider access, allowing smaller investors or institutions to
  participate in markets traditionally limited to large players. By lowering
  investment minimums, tokenization boosts liquidity – Singapore’s SGX digital
  bond platform saw market participation increase by 300% thanks to fractional
  bond tokens. Bonds that are tokenized can be traded peer-to-peer on regulated
  digital exchanges 24/7, expanding the investor base and creating continuous
  markets. Greater liquidity not only helps investors by providing easier entry
  and exit, but also can lead to better price discovery for issuers.
- **Continuous Compliance & Tracking:** Every transaction and holder of a
  tokenized bond is recorded on a shared ledger, providing a single source of
  truth for regulators, issuers, and investors. This real-time visibility into
  ownership and transaction history makes it easier to meet compliance
  standards, since there’s a clear, tamper-proof record of the bond’s journey.
  Smart contracts can enforce regulatory rules (for example, preventing a
  transfer if the recipient isn’t whitelisted or if it would breach ownership
  concentration limits). Such features dramatically cut down on reconciliation
  efforts – studies report up to an 85% decrease in manual reconciliation when
  bonds are tokenized – and simplify the task of auditing bond transactions and
  adherence to covenants.
- **Institutional Investment Innovation:** Financial institutions can create new
  fixed-income products by leveraging programmable bonds. For example, a bank
  could issue a tokenized bond that dynamically adjusts its coupon based on a
  reference rate, with the smart contract automatically handling rate changes.
  Institutions could also bundle tokenized bonds to create structured products
  or ETFs more easily, since the digital format simplifies managing the basket
  of underlying assets. These digital bonds can be integrated into treasury
  management systems or used as collateral in repo and lending operations with
  instant transfer of ownership, increasing the velocity and utility of bonds in
  the financial system.
