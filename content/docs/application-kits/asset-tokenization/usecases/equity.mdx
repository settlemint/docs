Tokenized equity involves converting shares of a company or fund into digital
tokens on a blockchain. These tokens confer ownership rights and often built-in
governance features (like voting or dividends). Financial institutions can use
tokenized equity for new investment platforms and to enhance corporate
governance processes:

- **Tokenized Private Equity & Illiquid Assets**: Banks and asset managers can
  digitize shares of private companies or real assets into tokens, allowing
  fractional ownership and easier transfer. This opens up traditionally illiquid
  investments to a broader pool of investors by lowering minimum ticket sizes.
  For example, a private equity fund could tokenize its LP shares so that
  smaller institutions or accredited investors can buy portions and trade them
  on a secondary market. Tokenization has the potential to increase liquidity by
  enabling 24/7 peer-to-peer trading of assets that once required years to exit.
  Investors benefit from flexibility (they can rebalance or sell earlier), while
  asset owners enjoy a larger capital base and potentially higher valuations due
  to improved marketability.
- **Shareholder Voting & Governance**: On-chain voting mechanisms can be
  implemented through tokenized equity. Each equity token can carry proportional
  voting rights that shareholders exercise through blockchain-based ballots.
  This greatly streamlines corporate governance – votes are recorded immutably
  and instantly tallied by smart contracts, reducing errors and the risk of
  fraud in proxy voting. Shareholders (even across borders) can participate in
  AGMs remotely, increasing engagement. For banks handling shareholder services,
  this means lower administrative cost (no mailing of paper ballots or manual
  counts) and more secure, transparent outcomes. Enhanced governance builds
  investor trust as every decision is auditable on-chain.
- **Real-Time Cap Table Management**: With tokenized equity, a company’s cap
  table (ownership register) updates automatically with each token transfer.
  This real-time cap table management simplifies due diligence and compliance –
  companies always know who their shareholders are, and certain transfers can be
  restricted via code to comply with regulations (e.g., blocking unaccredited
  investors). The blockchain serves as a single source of truth for ownership
  stakes, eliminating the need to reconcile records across lawyers, transfer
  agents, and custodians. Moreover, corporate actions like stock splits,
  dividends, or buybacks can be executed through smart contracts to instantly
  reflect on all token holders, reducing operational complexity for the issuing
  company.
- **Enhanced Corporate Governance & Transparency**: Tokenized equity can improve
  overall governance by providing unprecedented transparency and investor
  involvement. Key corporate information (like financial reports or cap table
  changes) can be shared on the token platform, giving stakeholders up-to-date
  data. If the equity tokens are used in a consortium or private market,
  regulators could even be given observer nodes to oversee transactions,
  ensuring compliance in real time. Such transparency, combined with automated
  compliance checks, means that regulatory reporting is largely built-in – for
  instance, an equity token could automatically prevent trades that would
  violate ownership disclosure thresholds. Companies benefit from stronger
  governance practices and easier audits, while investors enjoy greater
  confidence in the integrity of the market.
- **Innovative Investment Products**: Financial institutions can create new
  investment vehicles using tokenized equity. For example, a bank might offer a
  tokenized index fund or ETF where each token represents a small slice of a
  diversified equity portfolio, allowing clients to buy into the fund with ease
  and trade those positions on a secondary market. Tokens can also carry
  programmed rights – e.g., a revenue-sharing token where investors get a
  percentage of profits. This kind of financial product innovation is simpler
  with tokenized equity because distribution and management are handled via
  smart contracts. It reduces costs associated with issuing and administering
  funds (no lengthy paper processes or multiple intermediaries), savings that
  can be passed on to investors or retained as margin by the institution.

> Overall, tokenized equity reduces friction in equity markets – it cuts costs
> for raising capital and trading shares, provides global 24/7 market access,
> and unlocks liquidity in assets like private stock that once had none. These
> benefits come while staying within existing securities law frameworks, as
> tokens can be coded to enforce the same rules as traditional shares.
