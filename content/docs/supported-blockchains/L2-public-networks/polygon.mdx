## Why is Polygon's architecture ideal for enterprise scaling?

Polygon's unique dual-layer architecture combines the security of Ethereum with the performance advantages of dedicated sidechains, creating the perfect environment for enterprise blockchain applications.

### Polygon's Scaling Architecture

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Ethereum Security Layer**
    
    Polygon inherits Ethereum's battle-tested security through checkpointing, ensuring enterprise-grade protection for high-value transactions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Heimdall Validation Layer**
    
    Proof-of-Stake validators using MATIC tokens secure the network, enabling fast block production and efficient transaction processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Bor Block Production**
    
    High-performance execution layer produces blocks every 2 seconds, delivering the speed required for real-time enterprise applications.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Ethereum Finalization**
    
    Periodic checkpoints to Ethereum mainnet provide ultimate finality and dispute resolution for maximum security assurance.
  </Step>
</Steps>
