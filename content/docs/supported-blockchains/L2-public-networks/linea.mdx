## Linea zkEVM architecture at a glance

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Rollup Sequencing**

    Transactions are batched by Linea's sequencer and committed to Ethereum with data availability guarantees, preserving ordering and timestamping for audits.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Zero-Knowledge Proving**

    Proofs are generated using Consensys' lattice-based prover pipeline that balances throughput with cost efficiency, enabling predictable settlement windows.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Settlement on Ethereum**

    Aggregated proofs are validated on Ethereum mainnet contracts, ensuring finality anchored in Ethereum's Proof of Stake consensus.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Ecosystem Tooling**

    Developers access analytics, monitoring, and DevOps support through Consensys' platform services, ensuring successful production rollouts.
  </Step>
</Steps>
