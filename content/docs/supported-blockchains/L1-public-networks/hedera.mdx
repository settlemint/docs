## Which Hedera networks are supported?

<Cards>
  <Card 
    title="Hedera Mainnet" 
    description="Production network with real HBAR for live applications. Features enterprise-grade SLAs, regulatory compliance, and predictable transaction costs."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Hedera Testnet" 
    description="Development environment with free test HBAR for experimentation. Mirrors mainnet functionality for comprehensive testing and validation."

<Callout type="tip">
  **Cost Predictability**: Unlike Ethereum's variable gas fees, Hedera's transaction costs are fixed in USD equivalent, making it ideal for enterprise budgeting and cost forecasting.
</Callout>

## Why is Hashgraph consensus superior to blockchain?

Hedera's Hashgraph consensus represents a fundamental breakthrough in distributed ledger technology, offering mathematical guarantees that traditional blockchain cannot provide.

### Key Advantages Over Blockchain

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)">
    **Highest Security Standard**: Hashgraph achieves aBFT, the gold standard for consensus algorithms
    
    **Mathematical Proof**: Unlike blockchain's probabilistic finality, Hashgraph provides mathematical certainty
    
    **Network Resilience**: Continues operating even when up to 1/3 of nodes are malicious or offline
    
    **No Forks**: Eliminates the possibility of chain splits and double-spending attacks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fair Transaction Ordering">
    **Consensus Timestamps**: Every transaction receives a mathematically fair timestamp
    
    **No Front-Running**: Eliminates MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) exploitation common in blockchain
    
    **Predictable Ordering**: Transaction sequence is deterministic and cannot be manipulated
    
    **Enterprise Trust**: Critical for financial applications requiring fair market conditions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gossip-About-Gossip Protocol">
    **Efficient Communication**: Nodes share information about what they know others know
    
    **Exponential Spread**: Information propagates across the network in log(n) time
    
    **Virtual Voting**: Consensus is reached without explicit voting rounds
    
    **Bandwidth Optimization**: Minimizes network communication overhead
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### How Hashgraph Consensus Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Gossip Protocol**
    
    Nodes randomly select other nodes to share transaction information, creating a gossip graph of events.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Gossip About Gossip**
    
    Nodes also share information about what they've heard from others, creating a meta-layer of communication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Virtual Voting**
    
    Instead of explicit voting, nodes mathematically determine how others would vote based on the gossip graph.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Consensus Timestamp**
    
    Transactions receive fair, consensus timestamps that determine their final order in the ledger.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Performance Impact**: Hashgraph's efficiency means Hedera can process 10,000+ TPS with 3-5 second finality while maintaining the highest security standards, making it ideal for enterprise applications requiring both speed and certainty.
</Callout>

## How do you develop on Hedera with existing Ethereum tools?

### Deployment Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
  **Initial Deployment**: Smart contract deployments may experience timeouts due to Hedera's comprehensive transaction processing. This is normal and limited to the initial deployment phase.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure RPC Endpoint**
    
    Update your development environment to use Hedera's JSON-RPC relay endpoint instead of Ethereum's.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Deploy Smart Contracts**
    
    Use familiar tools like Remix or Hardhat. Initial deployments may take longer due to Hedera's thorough validation process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Integrate with Frontend**
    
    Connect your existing web3 frontend applications with no code changes required.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Monitor Performance**
    
    Enjoy faster transaction speeds and predictable costs compared to Ethereum mainnet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Best Practice**: Test smart contract deployments on Hedera testnet first. Once deployed successfully, contract interactions will be significantly faster and cheaper than Ethereum.
