## How does Lachesis consensus achieve instant finality?

Sonic's Lachesis consensus represents a breakthrough in blockchain technology, combining the security of Byzantine Fault Tolerance with the speed of DAG-based architectures.

### Lachesis Architecture

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)">
    **Ultimate Security**: Provides the highest level of security guarantee in distributed systems
    
    **Instant Finality**: Transactions are irreversibly confirmed within 1 second
    
    **Attack Resistance**: Remains secure even with up to 1/3 malicious validators
    
    **No Rollbacks**: Eliminates the possibility of transaction reversals or chain reorganizations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DAG-Based Event Structure">
    **Parallel Processing**: Multiple validators can process transactions simultaneously
    
    **Event Ordering**: Uses directed acyclic graph to establish causal relationships
    
    **Scalable Architecture**: Performance improves as more validators join the network
    
    **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structure minimizes storage requirements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gossip Protocol Communication">
    **Efficient Propagation**: Information spreads exponentially across the network
    
    **Minimal Bandwidth**: Reduces communication overhead compared to traditional consensus
    
    **Asynchronous Updates**: Validators don't need to wait for synchronous rounds
    
    **Fault Tolerance**: Network continues operating even with offline validators
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### How Lachesis Achieves Sub-Second Finality

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Transaction Submission**
    
    Users submit transactions to any validator node in the network.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Event Creation**
    
    Validators create events containing transactions and references to previous events, forming a DAG structure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Gossip Propagation**
    
    Events are shared with other validators through an efficient gossip protocol, spreading exponentially across the network.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Virtual Voting**
    
    Validators mathematically determine consensus without explicit voting rounds, using the DAG structure to establish event ordering.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Instant Finalization**
    
    Once sufficient events reference a transaction, it achieves irreversible finality in under 1 second.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Validator Economics

<Tabs items={['Staking Requirements', 'Reward Structure', 'Penalty System']}>
  <Tab value="Staking Requirements">
    - **Minimum Stake**: 500,000 FTM to run a validator
    - **Delegation Support**: Token holders can delegate to validators
    - **Self-Bonding**: Validators must stake their own FTM
    - **Lock Period**: Flexible unstaking with 7-day withdrawal delay
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Reward Structure">
    - **Base Rewards**: 4-15% annual percentage rate (APR)
    - **Performance Bonuses**: Higher rewards for consistent uptime
    - **Delegation Fees**: Validators earn commission on delegated stakes
    - **Compound Interest**: Rewards automatically restake
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Penalty System">
    - **Slashing Conditions**: Malicious behavior or extended downtime
    - **Graduated Penalties**: Proportional to severity of violation
    - **Double-Sign Protection**: Prevents accidental slashing
    - **Grace Period**: Temporary offline validators aren't penalized
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  **Energy Efficiency**: Lachesis consensus uses 99.9% less energy than Proof of Work while providing stronger security guarantees and instant finality.
