      Sonic, originally launched as Fantom in June 2018 by the Fantom Foundation
      and now rebranded, is a high-performance public blockchain network. It
      leverages a unique consensus mechanism called Lachesis and supports its
      native cryptocurrency, FTM. Sonic is designed to power decentralized
      applications (dApps), smart contracts, and fast transactions, using the
      Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity for development.

Sonic emphasizes rapid transaction processing, low costs, and scalability,
making it an attractive choice for both developers and enterprises. Unlike
traditional blockchain systems, Sonicâ€™s Lachesis consensus delivers near-instant
finality and high throughput without sacrificing decentralization.

## Mainnet and testnet

SettleMint supports the **Sonic Mainnet** and the **Sonic Testnet**.

The Mainnet is the primary public Sonic network, where real-value transactions
take place. Each transaction incurs a fee, payable in FTM, the native
cryptocurrency. The Testnet, conversely, is a development environment for
testing and experimentation. Testnet FTM has no real-world value, allowing
developers to experiment freely without financial risk.

You can view the Testnet as a sandbox for prototyping and the Mainnet as the
live production network, akin to staging versus production environments in
software development.

## Consensus mechanism

Sonic utilizes the **Lachesis** consensus algorithm, an asynchronous Byzantine
Fault Tolerant (aBFT) protocol built on a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
structure. This approach offers several key benefits:

- `High Throughput`: Sonic can handle thousands of transactions per second.
- `Near-Instant Finality`: Transactions are confirmed in seconds, ensuring quick
  settlement.
- `Security`: The aBFT design provides robust protection against malicious
  actors.

In Lachesis, nodes process transactions independently and share updates
asynchronously through a gossip protocol. This allows the network to reach
consensus rapidly and efficiently, maintaining decentralization and resilience.
Validators stake FTM to participate, with penalties for misbehavior, ensuring
network integrity while keeping energy use minimal compared to Proof of Work
systems.
