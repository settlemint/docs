## Which Ethereum networks does SettleMint support?

SettleMint provides access to both Ethereum **Mainnet** and testing environments including **Sepolia Testnet** and **Holesky Testnet**.

<Cards>
  <Card 
    title="Ethereum Mainnet" 
    description="Production network where real-value transactions occur. Each transaction requires ETH for gas fees. Best for live applications and production deployments."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Sepolia Testnet" 
    description="Primary testing environment with free test ETH. Ideal for development, testing smart contracts, and integration testing before mainnet deployment."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Holesky Testnet" 
    description="Long-term testnet designed for validator testing and large-scale experiments. Perfect for testing staking mechanisms and validator operations."
  />
</Cards>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Development Strategy**: Start with Sepolia for rapid prototyping, use Holesky for validator testing, then deploy to Mainnet for production. This three-tier approach minimizes risk and maximizes testing coverage.
</Callout>

## How do you connect to Ethereum on SettleMint?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Choose Your Network**
    
    Select between Ethereum Mainnet for production or Sepolia/Holesky testnets for development. SettleMint provides optimized RPC endpoints for all networks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configure Your Client**
    
    SettleMint uses **Geth**, the official Ethereum client written in Go. As the reference implementation with the largest user base, Geth ensures maximum compatibility and reliability.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Deploy Smart Contracts**
    
    Use Solidity to write smart contracts and deploy them using SettleMint's integrated development environment with built-in testing and deployment tools.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Monitor and Scale**
    
    Leverage SettleMint's monitoring dashboard to track transaction performance, gas usage, and network health for optimal application performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Technical Details**: Geth is the most widely adopted Ethereum client, powering over 60% of Ethereum nodes globally. Its extensive tooling ecosystem and active development make it the ideal choice for enterprise deployments.
</Callout>

More information on Geth can be found on the [official Geth website](https://geth.ethereum.org/).

## Why is Ethereum's Proof of Stake consensus ideal for enterprise?

Ethereum transitioned to **Proof of Stake (PoS)** in September 2022, delivering significant advantages for enterprise applications:

<Cards>
  <Card 
    title="Energy Efficiency" 
    description="99.9% reduction in energy consumption compared to Proof of Work, supporting ESG compliance and sustainability goals."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Economic Security" 
    description="Over $60 billion in staked ETH securing the network, creating the highest economic security threshold in blockchain history."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Fast Finality" 
    description="Transactions achieve probabilistic finality in 12.8 minutes, providing certainty for financial applications and enterprise workflows."
  />
  <Card 
    title="Predictable Performance" 
    description="Consistent 12-second block times enable reliable application performance and user experience optimization."
  />
</Cards>

### How does PoS validation work?

1. **Validator Selection**: Validators are chosen through a randomized algorithm weighted by their staked ETH amount
2. **Block Proposal**: Selected validators propose new blocks containing validated transactions  
3. **Attestation**: Other validators attest to the validity of proposed blocks
4. **Finalization**: Blocks become finalized after receiving sufficient attestations
5. **Rewards & Penalties**: Validators earn rewards for honest behavior or face slashing penalties for malicious actions

<Callout type="tip">
  **Enterprise Impact**: PoS enables enterprises to participate in network security through staking, potentially generating yield on ETH holdings while supporting network infrastructure.
</Callout>

More information on the consensus mechanism can be found on the [official Ethereum website](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/).
