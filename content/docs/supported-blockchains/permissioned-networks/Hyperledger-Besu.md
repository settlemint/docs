title: "Hyperledger Besu"

Enterprise Ethereum is the permissioned blockchain version of public Ethereum.
The two major Enterprise Ethereum clients are **Hyperledger Besu and Quorum**.
Both clients have implemented a permission layer, which only allows known nodes,
designed specifically for use in a consortium environment, to join the network.

## What is Hyperledger Besu?

Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Apache
2.0 license and written in Java. It was started by the Linux Foundation under
the Hyperledger umbrella project. This project is largely known for its
Hyperledger Fabric component, which is one of the most prominent permissioned
protocols in the blockchain space. While they both exist under the Hyperledger
umbrella, Fabric and Besu have little in common in terms of the underlying
technology. More specifically, whereas Fabric is a private protocol designed
from the ground up to support enterprise-grade solutions, Besu seeks to utilize
the public Ethereum network. Besu can run on the public network or on private
networks, as well as on a number of testnets. The project, formerly known as
Pantheon, joined the Hyperledger family in 2019, adding for the first time a
public blockchain implementation to Hyperledger's suite of private blockchain
frameworks.

## Features

Hyperledger Besu's main features include:

- **Permissioning**: Contrary to the Ethereum Mainnet, a permissioned network
  allows only specified nodes to join the network and to participate.
- **The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: The EVM is what enables the deployment
  and execution of Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Privacy**: The Private Transaction Manager makes it possible to keep
  transactions between predefined parties private from other users of the
  network.
- **User-facing API**: The client provides mainnet Ethereum and EEA JSON-RPC
  APIs over HTTP and WebSocket protocols. It also supports a GraphQL API.

Hyperledger Besu's enterprise features are designed to adhere to the
requirements of the
[Enteprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)](https://entethalliance.org/) client
specification.

## Consensus mechanisms

A consensus mechanism defines the rules for the nodes in a blockchain network to
reach an agreement on the current state of the blockchain ledger.

Besu comes with several consensus mechanisms. As an Ethereum implementation,
Proof of Work (PoW) is a given, but the **Proof of Authority (PoA)** options are
more suitable for enterprise projects. These can be used when participants know
each other and there is a level of trust between them, e.g. in a permissioned
consortium network.

PoA is a light and practical consensus mechanism that gives a small and
designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions within
the network and to create new blocks. This results in faster block times and a
much greater transaction throughput.

**SettleMint's Enterprise Ethereum networks always use QBFT**

In QBFT networks, a set of validator nodes is responsible for maintaining consensus on the blockchain. Similar to IBFT, these validators participate in a round-based process to propose and validate blocks. At the start of each round, one validator is chosen as the proposer. This proposer puts forward a new block to be added to the chain.

The remaining validators review the proposed block and share their votes. If a supermajority (at least 66%) of the validators agree that the block is valid, it is finalized and committed to the chain. Like IBFT 2.0, QBFT achieves immediate finality â€” blocks are either committed or discarded in a single round. There are no forks, and every valid block becomes a permanent part of the main chain.

QBFT enhances performance and fault tolerance over IBFT by introducing optimizations for large validator sets, making it better suited for enterprise-grade and high-throughput networks.

When you deploy a Hyperledger Besu blockchain network on SettleMint, it should
be Byzantine fault tolerance.
