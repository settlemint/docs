## How does SettleMint protect against blockchain-specific threats?

Enterprise blockchain deployments face unique security challenges that traditional IT security cannot address:

- **51% Attacks**: Consensus mechanism protection and network distribution
- **Private Key Compromise**: Hardware security modules (HSM) and multi-signature wallets
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Formal verification and automated security testing
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Decentralized oracle networks and data validation
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Security**: Multi-signature validation and time-lock mechanisms

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical Security Consideration**: Enterprise blockchain security requires specialized knowledge of cryptographic protocols, consensus mechanisms, and distributed system vulnerabilities that differ significantly from traditional web application security.
