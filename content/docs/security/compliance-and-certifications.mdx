## Why is blockchain compliance different from traditional IT compliance?

Blockchain technology introduces unique compliance challenges that traditional IT frameworks don't address:

- **Immutable Records**: Permanent data storage conflicts with data deletion requirements
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Distributed systems complicate jurisdictional compliance
- **Cryptographic Keys**: Private key management requires specialized security controls
- **Smart Contract Governance**: Automated code execution needs regulatory oversight
- **Cross-Border Transactions**: International regulatory requirements and reporting
