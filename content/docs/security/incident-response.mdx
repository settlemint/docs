# How do I respond to blockchain security incidents?

Blockchain security incidents can have severe financial and operational consequences, requiring specialized incident response capabilities that address both traditional IT security threats and blockchain-specific attack vectors. Our 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) provides enterprise-grade incident response for blockchain infrastructure and applications.

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical Response Time**: Blockchain security incidents involving financial assets require immediate response within minutes, not hours. Delayed response can result in permanent asset loss due to blockchain immutability.
</Callout>

## What makes blockchain incident response unique?

Traditional incident response focuses on containing and eradicating threats, but blockchain incidents introduce unique challenges:

- **Immutable Evidence**: Blockchain transactions create permanent forensic evidence
- **Financial Assets at Risk**: Direct financial loss through compromised private keys
- **Cross-Chain Complexity**: Incidents may span multiple blockchain networks
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Code-level incidents requiring specialized analysis
- **Decentralized Recovery**: Recovery may require coordinating with multiple parties
