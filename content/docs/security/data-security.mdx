We employ advanced encryption techniques and data protection measures to ensure
the security of data at all times.

## Data Encryption

Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard
encryption protocols.

- **In Transit**: Data is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher to protect it during
  transmission.
- **At Rest**: Data is encrypted using AES-256 to ensure it remains secure when
  stored.

## Data Backup and Recovery

Regular backups are performed, and data recovery plans are in place to ensure
quick restoration of services in the event of an incident.

- **Backup Frequency**: Backups are performed regularly to ensure that data can
  be restored to a recent state.
- **Recovery Plans**: Detailed recovery plans are in place to ensure quick and
  efficient restoration of services.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We have policies and procedures in place for data retention and secure deletion.

- **Data Retention**: Data is retained only as long as necessary for business
  purposes or as required by law.
- **Secure Deletion**: Data is securely deleted when it is no longer needed,
  using techniques such as degaussing and cryptographic wiping.
