title: Application Security
---

Our development process integrates security at every stage. We follow best
practices and employ advanced tools to ensure the security of our applications.

## Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Our SDLC incorporates security activities at each stage of development, such as
requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment.

- **Secure Coding Practices**: Promote secure coding practices within the
  development team, including adhering to coding standards and conducting code
  reviews.
- **Threat Modeling**: Perform threat modeling exercises to identify potential
  security threats and vulnerabilities at the design stage.
- **Secure Dependencies**: Manage and update all dependencies and third-party
  libraries used in the software to ensure they are free of vulnerabilities.

## Regular Security Testing

We conduct regular security testing throughout the development lifecycle to
identify and address potential security weaknesses.

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning tools are used to
  identify common vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party penetration tests are conducted
  to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. Our penetration testing includes
  network, application, and infrastructure assessments to ensure comprehensive
  coverage. SettleMint does not publicly share detailed results of network
  penetration tests, but high-level summaries and compliance reports can be
  provided to customers upon request.
- **Code Analysis**: Automated and manual code analysis to ensure that security
  flaws are identified and addressed.
