# What security policies are required for enterprise blockchain?

Enterprise blockchain deployments require comprehensive security policy frameworks that address regulatory compliance, operational risk management, and governance requirements. Our security governance framework provides policy templates, implementation guidance, and compliance monitoring for enterprise blockchain environments.

<Callout type="info">
**Policy Customization**: Our security policy framework adapts to industry-specific requirements including financial services, healthcare, government, and manufacturing compliance standards.
</Callout>

## Why do blockchain environments need specialized security policies?

Traditional IT security policies don't address the unique aspects of blockchain technology:

- **Immutable Operations**: Policies must address irreversible transactions and data
- **Cryptographic Key Management**: Specialized policies for private key governance
- **Decentralized Governance**: Multi-party governance and consensus mechanisms
- **Smart Contract Security**: Code-level security policies and audit requirements
- **Cross-Border Compliance**: Policies addressing multiple jurisdictions
