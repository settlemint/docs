SettleMint has established comprehensive security policies to safeguard our
systems and data. These policies are designed to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information.

## Data Protection and Privacy

We adhere to strict data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Personal
data is handled with the utmost care, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at
  rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Data Minimization**: We collect only the data necessary for our operations
  and limit access to it based on the principle of least privilege.

## Access Control

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for access to sensitive systems.
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that employees have the minimum
necessary access.

- **Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms, including MFA and SSO,
  are enforced across our systems.
- **Authorization**: Access to resources is granted based on roles and
  responsibilities, ensuring that users only have access to what they need.

## Incident Response

Our incident response policy outlines the procedures for detecting, responding
to, and recovering from security incidents.

- **Incident Detection**: Continuous monitoring and automated alerting systems
  to detect potential security incidents.
- **Incident Handling**: A dedicated incident response team is available 24/7 to
  handle security incidents promptly.
- **Incident Recovery**: Comprehensive recovery plans to ensure quick
  restoration of services and data integrity.

## Employee Training and Awareness

Continuous training and awareness programs are crucial to maintaining our
security posture. Employees undergo regular security training to stay updated on
the latest threats and best practices.

- **Training Programs**: Regular security training sessions for all employees.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Ongoing awareness campaigns to reinforce the
  importance of security in daily operations.

## Third-Party Security

SettleMint's third-party agreements include provisions for the security and
protection of information and assets. These agreements ensure that all partners
and vendors adhere to our stringent security requirements, maintaining a
consistent security posture across our supply chain.

- **Vendor Assessments**: We conduct regular security assessments of our vendors
  to ensure compliance with our security standards.
- **Contractual Obligations**: Security requirements are embedded in our
  third-party contracts to ensure ongoing compliance.
