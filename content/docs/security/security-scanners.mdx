title: Security Scanners
---

SettleMint uses advanced security scanners to maintain the integrity and
security of our codebase and dependencies. This page provides detailed
information about the scanners we use, including Aikido, TruffleHog, and
Renovate.

## Aikido

Aikido is a comprehensive security platform that provides a variety of tools for
vulnerability management and penetration testing. It includes multiple scanners
to cover different aspects of security:

- **ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: Used for penetration testing and finding
  vulnerabilities in web applications. It helps identify issues such as SQL
  injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security threats.
- **Trivy**: A comprehensive security scanner for container images, file
  systems, and Git repositories. It detects vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
  and secrets.
- **Clair**: An open-source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities
  in application containers (currently supports Docker). It scans container
  images for known vulnerabilities in the packages installed.
- **Nuclei**: A fast, customizable vulnerability scanner based on templates. It
  helps in identifying security issues across various protocols.
- **Bandit**: A security linter for Python code that finds common security
  issues in Python code.
- **Gitleaks**: A tool for detecting hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys,
  and tokens in Git repositories.
- **Syft**: Used for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and open
  source license scanning.
- **Grype**: A vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems.
- **Checkov**: An infrastructure as code (IaC) static analysis tool that detects
  misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure.
- **Phylum**: Detects malware in dependencies.
- **endoflife.date**: Detects outdated and end-of-life software.

Aikido ensures that security is maintained throughout the development lifecycle
by providing continuous monitoring and automated testing.

### Cloud Infrastructure Integration

In addition to these scanners, Aikido is integrated with our cloud
infrastructure to ensure secure operations. This integration allows us to run
our infrastructure in a secure manner, leveraging the power of these tools to
continuously monitor, assess, and improve the security posture of our cloud
environments.

## TruffleHog

TruffleHog is a tool for detecting secrets in the codebase. It scans for
high-entropy strings and other potential secrets in the code repositories,
ensuring that sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and tokens are
not exposed in the source code.

- **High-Entropy String Detection**: Identifies strings that may be secrets
  based on entropy.
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses regular expressions to identify potential secrets
  based on known patterns.

## Renovate

Renovate is a dependency management tool that automates the process of updating
dependencies. It regularly scans for outdated or vulnerable dependencies and
creates pull requests to update them.

- **Automated Dependency Updates**: Regularly scans and updates dependencies to
  the latest versions.
- **Pull Request Creation**: Automatically generates pull requests for updates,
  simplifying the update process.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Ensures that updates are compatible with the
  existing codebase, reducing the risk of breaking changes.

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

These security scanners are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to provide
continuous security checks and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and
addressed promptly.

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated security scans are performed at each
  stage of the development process.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Ensures that only secure and compliant code is
  deployed to production.

By using these advanced security scanners, SettleMint maintains a high level of
security for its applications and infrastructure, protecting against a wide
range of threats and vulnerabilities.
