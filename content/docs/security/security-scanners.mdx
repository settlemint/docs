# What security scanning tools protect blockchain applications?

Enterprise blockchain applications require specialized security scanning that addresses both traditional application vulnerabilities and blockchain-specific threats. Our comprehensive scanning framework integrates multiple security tools throughout the development lifecycle to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance violations before they reach production.

<Callout type="info">
**Continuous Security Validation**: Our automated security scanning pipeline runs over 15 different security tools, performing more than 10,000 security checks on every code commit and container build.
</Callout>

## Why do blockchain applications need specialized security scanning?

Traditional application security scanners don't detect blockchain-specific vulnerabilities:

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy, integer overflow, and access control issues
- **Cryptographic Implementation Flaws**: Weak random number generation and key management
- **Consensus Mechanism Attacks**: MEV exploitation and front-running vulnerabilities  
- **Cross-Chain Security**: Bridge vulnerabilities and atomic swap attacks
- **DeFi Protocol Risks**: Flash loan attacks and oracle manipulation
