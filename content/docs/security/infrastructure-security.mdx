title: Infrastructure Security
---

Our infrastructure is designed with multiple layers of security to protect
against various threats. We employ advanced technologies and best practices to
ensure the security and resilience of our systems.

## Cloud Security

Our cloud providers are industry leaders, offering robust security features and
compliance certifications.

- **DDoS Protection**: Advanced DDoS protection mechanisms to prevent and
  mitigate distributed denial-of-service attacks.
- **Network Security**: Secure network architecture with firewalls, intrusion
  detection systems, and network segmentation to protect against unauthorized
  access and threats.

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

Our blockchain platform is designed with a focus on ensuring high availability
and robust disaster recovery to maintain uninterrupted service and secure data
integrity under various conditions.

- **Redundancy**: Critical components are redundant, ensuring that the failure
  of a single component does not affect the overall system.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Utilize Velero for efficient backup and restoration
  in DR scenarios, managed by cluster operators.
- **Geographically Distributed Nodes**: Enabling blockchain node deployment
  across multiple data centers in different regions to enhance resilience
  against regional outages and optimize performance globally.
- **Inter-Cluster Synchronization**: We use advanced consensus protocols for
  real-time data synchronization across clusters, ensuring data consistency and
  integrity.
- **Automatic Failover Mechanisms**: Critical components like transaction
  processing nodes and storage have automatic failover, with hot standby nodes
  for immediate takeover.
- **Load Balancing**: We apply sophisticated load balancing to evenly distribute
  workloads and prevent overloads, enhancing network performance.

## Tamper Audit and Software Integrity

SettleMint's Kubernetes and container management infrastructure includes tamper
audit and software integrity functions to detect changes in container builds or
configurations. These measures ensure the integrity of release artifacts and
workloads by using tools such as image signing, admission controllers, and
runtime security tools to monitor and secure the environment. Continuous
monitoring and automated checks help maintain a secure Kubernetes deployment.

## Access Control and Monitoring

SettleMint restricts, logs, and monitors access to all critical systems,
including hypervisors, firewalls, vulnerability scanners, network sniffers, and
APIs. This comprehensive access control and monitoring ensure that only
authorized personnel can access these systems, enhancing security and
accountability.

### Monitoring Privileged Access

SettleMint monitors and logs privileged access (administrator level) to
information security management systems. This practice ensures that all
administrative actions are tracked and reviewed, enhancing security and
accountability by detecting and responding to any unauthorized or suspicious
activities.
