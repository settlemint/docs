# How do I secure blockchain infrastructure at enterprise scale?

Enterprise blockchain infrastructure requires military-grade security architecture that can handle mission-critical workloads, regulatory compliance, and high-value digital assets. Our multi-layered security approach protects against advanced persistent threats while maintaining 99.9% uptime and regulatory compliance across global deployments.

<Callout type="warn">
**Enterprise Security Requirement**: Blockchain infrastructure security requires specialized hardening that goes beyond traditional cloud security due to consensus mechanisms, cryptographic operations, and immutable transaction processing.
</Callout>

## Why is blockchain infrastructure security uniquely complex?

Traditional infrastructure security focuses on protecting centralized systems, but blockchain infrastructure introduces unique challenges:

- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Specialized security for proof-of-stake and proof-of-work systems
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Hardware security modules and secure key management
- **Immutable Operations**: No ability to "undo" compromised transactions
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Security across multiple nodes and jurisdictions
- **High-Value Targets**: Infrastructure directly controls valuable digital assets
