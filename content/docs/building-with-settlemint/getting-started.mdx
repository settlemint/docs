## Application development journey on SettleMint

1. **Blockchain infrastructure setup** (network and node configuration)
2. **Security & compliance** (private key management, authentication tokens)
3. **Smart contract development** (code studio, SDK, CLI)
4. **Middleware & API creation** (API portal, graph middleware, FabConnect)
5. **Off-chain data storage and integration** (Hasura, S3, IPFS)
6. **Deployment & scaling** (package, deploy, scale)

**Brief Step-by-Step Guide** to help you create a working blockchain app
quickly.

### 1. Lay the foundation

Use the **blockchain network manager** to configure a public (e.g., Ethereum) or
private (e.g., Besu, Quorum, Fabric) network. Deploy **blockchain
nodes**—validating for consensus, non-validating for load distribution. Add a
**blockchain load balancer** to handle traffic and set up the **transaction
signer** for secure transaction submissions. Finally, confirm everything is
operational in the **blockchain explorer**.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Define application scope (supply chain, identity, etc.). 2. In the network
manager, select and configure your network (public or private). 3. Spin up
validating or non-validating nodes. 4. Enable load balancing and secure
transaction signing. 5. Check network activity and node health in the explorer.

### 2. Generate keys and tokens

Select the right private key management strategy—software, HD wallets, or
HSM—based on your security profile. Generate private keys and attach them to
transaction signers. Generate and use **access tokens (PAT/AAT)** for
controlling platform or API interactions.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Pick a key management approach that fits your risk tolerance. 2. Issue PATs
for developers, AATs for back-end services. 3. Set up logging, monitoring, and
regular security reviews. 4. Conduct or schedule compliance audits as needed. 5.
Document any custom security protocols for internal reference.

### 3. Develop and deploy smart contracts

Write on-chain logic in **code studio** (Solidity/Chaincode) or the **SDK CLI**.
Rely on frameworks like Foundry/Hardhat for testing, then compile and deploy
once you're satisfied. The platform tracks deployments for easy rollback and
version control.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Write your contract using code studio or your preferred IDE. 2. Test
thoroughly using built-in or external test frameworks. 3. Compile and deploy to
a test network. 4. Inspect events in the explorer to verify success. 5. Move to
production upon final validation.

### 4. Setup middleware and get APIs

The **smart contract API portal** converts your contract ABI into immediate REST
or GraphQL endpoints. The **graph middleware** handles read operations, indexing
on-chain data for fast queries. If required, the **Ethereum attestation
indexer** can manage trust attestations for identity or compliance.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Upload your contract ABI to the smart contract API portal. 2. Check
automatically generated REST/GraphQL endpoints. 3. Configure graph middleware
for event indexing using sub-graphs 4. Add specialized indexers (e.g., EAS) for
credential or compliance data. 5. Test endpoints in a simple front end or
script.

### 5. Integrate and finalize the application

Enterprise-grade dApps often require off-chain data handling. Connect **S3
(MinIO)** or **IPFS** for files, and use **Hasura** on PostgreSQL for structured
data. Meanwhile, orchestrate off-chain triggers with the **integration studio**
(e.g., emailing the admin after a token transfer). By the end, your blockchain
logic seamlessly interacts with centralized services.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Decide on S3 vs. IPFS for file needs. 2. Implement Hasura GraphQL for
off-chain data queries and updates. 3. Configure events in integration studio to
automate workflows. 4. Sync on-chain calls and off-chain records in real time.
5. Confirm data consistency and reliability via logs or explorer audits.

### 6. Deploy, monitor, and scale

Finally, **containerize** your front end (React, Angular, Vue) and back-end
microservices. SettleMint's **custom deployments** module makes updates
simpler—no downtime or big reconfigurations. Continuous monitoring checks
performance and security, letting you expand capacity as your user base grows.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Package all components into containers. 2. Deploy them (SaaS or self-managed)
via SettleMint's interface. 3. Benchmark performance under typical and peak
loads. 4. Fine-tune scaling rules and resource allocations. 5. Iterate on your
solution as usage patterns evolve.
