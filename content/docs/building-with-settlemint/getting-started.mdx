**For Enterprise Teams & Developers**: Skip months of blockchain infrastructure setup and focus on building your business logic. SettleMint provides everything needed to deploy production-ready blockchain applications in days, not months.
</Callout>

## Which blockchain platform should you choose for your project?

<Callout type="question">
**Common Question**: "I'm building a blockchain application but don't know which platform to choose. What are the key differences between EVM chains, Hyperledger Fabric, and pre-built application kits?"
</Callout>

**Answer**: Your choice depends on your project requirements:
- **EVM chains** (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) for public/permissionless applications with cryptocurrency features
- **Hyperledger Fabric** for private enterprise networks with strict data privacy requirements  
- **Application kits** for rapid prototyping with pre-built smart contracts and UI components

### Development time comparison:
- **Traditional blockchain development**: 6-12 months
- **With SettleMint**: 2-4 weeks from concept to production

## Should you use managed SaaS or self-hosted infrastructure?

<Callout type="question">
**Common Question**: "What's the difference between SettleMint's managed SaaS and self-hosted options? Which one should I choose for my enterprise blockchain project?"
</Callout>

**Answer**: Choose based on your organization's requirements:
- **SaaS** for fast time-to-market with zero DevOps overhead (recommended for most projects)
- **Self-managed** for strict compliance requirements or existing Kubernetes infrastructure

### Cost & time implications:
- **SaaS**: Production-ready in 1-2 days, no infrastructure costs
- **Self-managed**: 1-2 weeks setup, full control over infrastructure and compliance
