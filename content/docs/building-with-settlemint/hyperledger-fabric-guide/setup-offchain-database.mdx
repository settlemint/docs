  Summary  
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
To integrate off-chain storage into your blockchain application, you should begin by adding Hasura as a backend-as-a-service via SettleMint. This will provision a fully managed PostgreSQL database, paired with a real-time GraphQL API layer. It enables you to manage non-critical or frequently updated data that doesn’t need to live on-chain, without compromising performance or flexibility.

Start by navigating to your application and opening the Integration Tools section. Click on Add an integration tool, select Hasura, and follow the steps to choose a name, provider, region, and resource plan. Once deployed, a dedicated Hasura instance will be available, complete with its own admin console, GraphQL API, and Postgres connection string. You can manage and monitor the instance from the same interface.

Once Hasura is set up, you can define your database schema by creating tables and relationships under the Data tab. You can add, modify, and delete rows directly from the console, or connect to the database using a PostgreSQL client or code. Every schema and table you define becomes instantly queryable using the GraphQL API. The API tab will auto-generate queries and mutations, and also allow you to derive REST endpoints or export code snippets for frontend/backend use.

For custom business logic, you can implement Actions, which are HTTP handlers triggered by GraphQL mutations. These are useful for data validation, enrichment, or chaining smart contract calls. If you want to respond to database changes in real-time, use Event Triggers to invoke webhooks when specific inserts, updates, or deletions happen. For recurring jobs, Cron Triggers can invoke workflows on a schedule, and One-off Scheduled Events allow precision control over future events.

Authentication and authorization can be finely controlled through role-based access rules. Hasura allows you to enforce row-level permissions and restrict query types based on user roles. To ensure secure API access, use the Hasura admin secret and your application access token, both available from the Connect tab of your Hasura console.

You’ll also have the option to connect to the Hasura PostgreSQL instance directly using the connection string. This is useful for running SQL scripts, performing migrations, or executing batch jobs. Whether you’re using a Node.js backend or a command-line tool like psql, your Hasura database acts like any standard PostgreSQL instance, with enterprise-grade reliability.

Backups are easy to configure using the pg_dump utility or via the Hasura CLI. You can export both your database data and metadata, and restore them in new environments as needed. Use hasura metadata export to get a full snapshot of your permissions, tracked tables, actions, and relationships. Then use hasura metadata apply or hasura metadata reload to rehydrate or sync a new instance.

By combining Hasura’s flexibility with the immutability of your on-chain smart contracts, you will be able to design a clean hybrid architecture—critical operations are stored securely on-chain, while scalable, queryable, and user-driven data remains off-chain. This setup dramatically improves user experience, simplifies front-end development, and keeps infrastructure costs under control.

Many dApps need more than just decentralized tools to build an end-to-end
solution. The SettleMint Hasura SDK provides a seamless way to interact with
Hasura GraphQL APIs for managing application data.

## Need for a On-chain and Off-chain Data Architecture

In blockchain-based applications, not all data needs to—or should—reside
on-chain. While critical state changes, token ownerships, or verifiable proofs
are best kept immutable and transparent on a blockchain, a large portion of
application data such as user profiles, analytics, logs, metadata, and UI-driven
state is better suited to an off-chain data store. Storing everything on-chain
is neither cost-effective nor performance-friendly. On-chain data is expensive
to store and slow to query for complex front-end or dashboard use cases.

This is where a **hybrid architecture** becomes essential. In such an approach,
data is partitioned based on its importance and usage:

- **On-chain layer** serves as the source of truth for verifiable,
  consensus-driven actions like token transfers, proofs, and governance.
- **Off-chain layer** handles high-volume, user-generated, or fast-changing data
  that benefits from relational structure, rich queries, and low latency.

This model provides the best of both worlds: **immutability and trust from
blockchain**, and **speed, flexibility, and developer-friendliness from
traditional databases**.

## How Hasura on SettleMint Supports This Architecture

SettleMint offers Hasura as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), tightly integrated
into its low-code blockchain development stack. Hasura provides a
high-performance, real-time GraphQL API layer on top of a PostgreSQL database,
and allows developers to instantly query, filter, and subscribe to changes in
the data without writing custom backend logic.

### Key Capabilities of Hasura on SettleMint

- A fully managed **PostgreSQL database** is provisioned automatically with each
  Hasura instance.
- Hasura auto-generates a powerful and expressive **GraphQL API** for all the
  tables and relationships defined in the database.
- It allows **integration with external databases** or REST/GraphQL services,
  making it possible to unify multiple data sources behind one GraphQL endpoint.
- **Role-based access control** ensures secure data access aligned with business
  logic and user permissions.

## Benefits of Using Hasura in a Blockchain Project

Hasura is especially useful for building interfaces, dashboards, and off-chain
tools in blockchain applications. Developers can use it to:

- Store non-critical or frequently updated data like user preferences, audit
  logs, or API call metadata.
- Power admin panels or reporting dashboards with complex filtering, sorting,
  and aggregation capabilities.
- Perform fast and reliable queries without the overhead of smart contract reads
  or event processing.
- Sync or mirror blockchain data into Postgres via indexing services (like The
  Graph or custom workers), and build additional logic around it.

For example, while the verification of a credential or the execution of a
transaction happens on-chain, the user’s profile details, usage history, or
interactions with the platform can be managed off-chain using Hasura. This
results in a responsive and scalable user experience, without compromising on
the core security and trust guarantees of blockchain.

## Some Basic Features

- Under the data subtab you can create an arbitrary number of **schema's**. A
  schema is a collection of tables.
- In a schema you can create **tables**, choose which columns you want and
  define relations and indexes.
- You can add, edit and delete **data** in these columns as well.
  [Learn more here](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/schema/postgres/tables/)

Any table you make is instantly visible in the **API subtab**. Note that by
using the **REST and Derive Action buttons** you can convert queries into REST
endpoints if that fits your application better. Using the **Code Exporter
button** you can get the actual code snippets you can use in your application or
the integration studio.

A bit more advanced are **actions**. Actions are custom queries or mutations
that are resolved via HTTP handlers. Actions can be used to carry out complex
data validations, data enrichment from external sources or execute just about
any custom business logic. Actions can be kickstarted by using the **Derive
Action button** in the **API subtab**.
[Learn more here.](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/actions/overview/)

If you need to execute tasks based on changes to your database you can leverage
**Events**. An **Event Trigger** atomically captures events (insert, update,
delete) on a specified table and then reliably calls a HTTP webhook to run some
custom business logic.
[Learn more here.](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/event-triggers/index.html)

**Cron Triggers** can be used to reliably trigger HTTP endpoints to run some
custom business logic periodically based on a cron schedule.

**One-off Scheduled Events** are individual events that can be scheduled to
reliably trigger a HTTP webhook to run some custom business logic at a
particular timestamp.

**Access to your database** can be handled all the way to the row level by using
the authentication and authorisation options available in Hasura.
[Learn more here.](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/auth/overview/)

This is of course on top of the
[application access tokens](/building-with-settlemint/application-access-tokens)
and [personal access tokens](/building-with-settlemint/personal-access-tokens)
in the platform you can use to close off access to the entire API.



## Usage Examples

You can interact with your Hasura database in two ways: through the GraphQL API
(recommended) or directly via PostgreSQL connection.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL API (Recommended)', 'PostgreSQL']}>
  <Tab value="GraphQL API (Recommended)">
    ```javascript

## Hasura Postgress database access and connection

![Hasura Connect](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hasura-connect.png)

For GraphQL API:

1. **Hasura Admin Secret**: Found in the "Connect" tab of Hasura console
2. **Application Access Token**: Generate this by following our
   [Application Access Tokens guide](/building-with-settlemint/application-access-tokens)

For PostgreSQL:

1. **PostgreSQL Connection String**: Found in the "Connect" tab of Hasura
   console under "Database URL"

<Callout type="warning">
  Always keep your credentials secure and never expose them in client-side code.
  Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system in
  production environments.
</Callout>

Understanding postgress connection string 

**postgresql://hasura-f1cd9:0c510604a378d348e7ed@p2p.gke-europe.settlemint.com:30787/hasura-f1cd9**

Here's how it's broken down:

- **Protocol**: `postgresql://`  
  Indicates the connection type — PostgreSQL database over TCP.

- **Username**: `hasura-f1cd9`  
  The database username used for authentication.

- **Password**: `0c510604a378d348e7ed`  
  The corresponding password for the above username.

- **Host**: `p2p.gke-europe.settlemint.com`  
  The server address (domain or IP) where the PostgreSQL database is hosted.

- **Port**: `30787`  
  The network port on which the PostgreSQL service is listening.

- **Database Name**: `hasura-f1cd9`  
  The specific PostgreSQL database to connect to on that server.


## Hasura Backup

Via CLI pgdump command

```sql
PGPASSWORD=0c510604a378d348e7ed pg_dump \
  -h p2p.gke-europe.settlemint.com \
  -p 30787 \
  -U hasura-f1cd9 \
  -d hasura-f1cd9 \
  -F p \
  -f ~/Desktop/hasura_backup.sql
  ```



## Taking backup via Hasura CLI

1. Hasura Database
2. Hasura Metadata

### Steps for taking a backup of Hasura Database

1. Install Hasura CLI
   (https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/)
2. Run hasura init command to initiate a new Hasura project in the working
   directory.
3. Edit config.yaml file to configure remote Hasura instance. We need to
   generate an API Key in BPaaS and pass it with the endpoint.

Syntax of config.yaml:

```
version: 3
endpoint: <hasura-db-endpoint-here/API-key>
admin_secret: <admin-secret-here>
metadata_directory: metadata
actions:
 kind: synchronous
 handler_webhook_baseurl: http://localhost:3000
```

Example

```
endpoint: https://hasuradb-15ce.gke-japan.settlemint.com/sm_aat_86530f5bf93d82a9
admin_secret: dc5eb1b93f43fd28c53e
metadata_directory: metadata
actions:
 kind: synchronous
 handler_webhook_baseurl: http://localhost:3000

```

4. Run hasura console command. (this command will sync everything to your local
   hasura instance.)
5. Run this curl command to generate DB export:

Curl Format

```
curl -d '{"opts": [ "-O", "-x", "--schema=public", "--inserts"], "clean_output": true, "source": "default"}' -H "x-hasura-admin-secret: <SecretKey>" <Endpoint URL/APIKey>/v1alpha1/pg_dump > db.sql
```

Example Curl

```
curl -d '{"opts": [ "-O", "-x", "--schema=public", "--inserts"], "clean_output": true, "source": "default"}' -H "x-hasura-admin-secret:78b0e4618125322de0eb" https://fuchsiacapybara-7f70.gke-europe.settlemint.com/bpaas-1d79Acd6A2f112EA450F1C07a372a7D582E6121F/v1alpha1/pg_dump > db.sql
```

### Importing data into a new instance

Please copy the content of the exported db.sql file, paste it and execute as a
SQL statement.



### Steps for taking a backup of Hasura Metadata

Hasura Metadata Export is a collection of yaml files which captures all the
Metadata required by the GraphQL Engine. This includes info about tables that
are tracked, permission rules, relationships, and event triggers that are
defined on those tables.

If you have already initialized your project via the Hasura CLI you should see
the Metadata directory structure in your project directory.

To export your entire Metadata using the Hasura CLI execute the following
command in your terminal:

```
#in hasura CLI
hasura metadata export
```

This will export the Metadata as YAML files in the /metadata directory

### Steps for importing or applying Hasura Metadata

You can apply Metadata from one Hasura Server instance to another. You can also
apply an older or modified version of an instance's Metadata onto itself to
replace the existing Metadata. Applying or importing completely replaces the
Metadata on that instance, i.e. you lose any Metadata that existed before
applying.

```
#in hasura CLI
hasura metadata apply
```

### Reload Hasura Metadata

In some cases, the Metadata can be out of sync with the database schema. For
example, when a new column has been added to a table via an external tool.

```
#in hasura CLI
hasura metadata reload
```
