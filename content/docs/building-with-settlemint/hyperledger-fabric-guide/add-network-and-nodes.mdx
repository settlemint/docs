  Summary  
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
To build a blockchain application, the first step is setting up a blockchain network with the correct number of validating and non-validating nodes. You can either deploy a permissioned network such as Hyperledger Besu or GoQuorum, or connect to an L1 or L2 Public Network like Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Hedera, Polygon zkEVM, Avalanche, Arbitrum, or Optimism. Both mainnet and testnet versions are available for public networks.

When creating an application on SettleMint, you will be prompted to select a
network and assign it a name. By default, a first validating node is deployed
along with the network, and you must assign a name to it as well. You may
optionally provide an EC DSA P256 private key to use as custom key material for
the node identity. If no key is provided, SettleMint will generate one
automatically and save it in your private keys.

In SettleMint-managed (SaaS) mode, you will need to choose between a shared or
dedicated cluster for deployment. You can also select a cloud provider and a
data center of your choice. Additionally, you will have the option to select
from small, medium, or large resource packs, which can be scaled up or down
later as needed.

Before deploying the network, you will have the option to configure network
settings and customize the genesis file. For most use cases, it is recommended
to keep the default settings. Once configured, you can proceed with deployment.
After a few minutes, your network manager and first node will be fully
operational.

To enhance reliability, you should add more nodes to your network for fault
tolerance. The best practice is to deploy four validator nodes and two
non-validator nodes. Once the nodes are set up, adding a load balancer will help
distribute network traffic efficiently and improve performance.

Once your network, nodes, and load balancer are running, you can access the
Insights tab to integrate monitoring tools. For permissioned networks, you can
add Blockscout Blockchain Explorer to track transactions and network activity.
If you are using public EVM networks, publicly available blockchain explorers
can be used instead.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a blockchain network, you need to have an application created
in your workspace. Applications provide the organizational context for all your
blockchain resources including networks, nodes, and development tools. If you
haven't created an application yet, follow our
[Create Application](/building-with-settlemint/evm-chains-guide/create-an-organization-and-application)
guide first.

## 1. Add Blockchain Network

For EVM Chains, SettleMint offers Hyperledger Besu and Quorum for permissioned
networks and a bunch of public networks to choose from. For the list of
supported networks please refer -
[Supported Networks](/platform-components/blockchain-infrastructure/network-manager#supported-blockchain-network-protocols)

![Select Network](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-network-fabric.png)

When we deploy a network, first node is automatically deployed with it and is an
orderer node. Once you have deployed a permissioned network or joined a public
network, you can add more nodes to it.

## 2. Add Blockchain Nodes

To see and add nodes, please click on **Blockchain Nodes** tile on the dashboard
or use the **Blockchain Nodes** link in the left menu.

![Add Node](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-fabric-node-ui.png)

![Fabric Network Config](../../../img/platfrom-components/fabric-config.png)
Users can configure the following settings before deploying a **Fabric
network**:

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endorsement Policy           | Defines transaction endorsement requirements ("By all peers" or "By majority of peers"). |
| Batch Timeout                | Time before transactions are grouped into a block.                                       |
| Max Messages in Batch        | Maximum number of messages in a batch.                                                   |
| Absolute Max Bytes in Batch  | Upper limit on batch size in megabytes (MB).                                             |
| Preferred Max Bytes in Batch | Preferred batch size in megabytes (MB).                                                  |

#### Channel Configuration and Policies

Hyperledger Fabric networks use a `configtx.json` file to define network
channels, membership rules, and policies. Key components include:

- **Application Group**: Defines policies for participating organizations,
  specifying details such as:
  - **Organization Name**
  - **Policies**:
    - **Admin**: Roles allow users to modify configurations.
    - **Endorsement**: Policies require transaction approvals from specific
      peers.
    - **Readers and Writers**: Policies define access to channel data.
- **Orderer Group**: Configures the ordering service responsible for transaction
  finalization. Settings include:
  - **Batch Timeout**: Determines the time before transactions are grouped into
    a block.
  - **Max Messages Per Batch**: Controls block size.
- **Consensus Type**: Typically `etcdraft`, a Raft-based ordering service.

#### Network Governance and Security

Hyperledger Fabric networks require robust security and governance mechanisms:

- **Membership Service Provider (MSP)**: Controls identity verification and
  authentication, ensuring only authorized participants can access the network.
- **Root Certificates and TLS Certificates**: Define trusted entities for secure
  communication.
- **Endorsement Policies**: Determine how transactions are validated across
  organizations, enforcing compliance and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Block Validation Policies**: Ensure the integrity and security of the
  distributed ledger, maintaining network trustworthiness.
