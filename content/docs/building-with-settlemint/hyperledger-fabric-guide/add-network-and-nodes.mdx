<Callout type="info" title="Enterprise Blockchain Infrastructure Setup">
Enterprise blockchain applications require permissioned networks with proper governance, compliance controls, and fault-tolerant infrastructure. Hyperledger Fabric provides the enterprise-grade features needed for regulated industries including healthcare, finance, supply chain, and government sectors.
</Callout>

## Why Do Enterprises Choose Hyperledger Fabric for Permissioned Networks?

Enterprise organizations deploy Hyperledger Fabric when they need:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in identity management and access controls for GDPR, SOX, and industry-specific regulations
- **Consortium Governance**: Multi-organization networks with defined roles and permissions
- **Data Privacy**: Channel-based isolation and private data collections for sensitive information
- **Performance Requirements**: High-throughput transaction processing for business-critical applications
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure and legacy systems

<Card title="Deployment Timeline" icon="clock">
**Typical enterprise deployment**: 15-30 minutes for initial network setup, with additional time for consortium member onboarding and compliance configurations.
</Card>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a blockchain network, you need to have an application created
in your workspace. Applications provide the organizational context for all your
blockchain resources including networks, nodes, and development tools. If you
haven't created an application yet, follow our
[Create Application](/building-with-settlemint/evm-chains-guide/create-an-organization-and-application)
guide first.

## How Do I Deploy a Permissioned Enterprise Network?

<Steps>
### Select Hyperledger Fabric Network Type

Choose Hyperledger Fabric for enterprise permissioned networks that require:
- Identity and access management
- Channel-based data isolation
- Consortium governance structures
- Regulatory compliance features

For comprehensive network options, refer to our [Supported Networks](/platform-components/blockchain-infrastructure/network-manager#supported-blockchain-network-protocols) guide.

### Configure Initial Network Deployment

![Select Network](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-network-fabric.png)

When deploying a Fabric network, the first orderer node is automatically provisioned to establish the ordering service foundation for your consortium.
</Steps>

## How Do I Add Nodes for Enterprise Fault Tolerance?

<Steps>
### Access Node Management

Navigate to **Blockchain Nodes** from your application dashboard or left menu to manage your network infrastructure.

![Add Node](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-fabric-node-ui.png)

### Plan Your Consortium Architecture

Enterprise Fabric networks require careful planning for production deployments. Development networks can operate with minimal nodes, but production environments mandate fault-tolerant configurations using Raft consensus across multiple organizations.
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Enterprise Production Requirements">
Production enterprise networks require redundant infrastructure to meet SLA requirements and regulatory compliance standards. Single points of failure can compromise business continuity and regulatory audit trails.
</Callout>

### What's the Recommended Node Setup for Enterprise Production?

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Channel configuration and policies

Hyperledger Fabric networks use a `configtx.json` file to define network
channels, membership rules, and policies. Key components include:

- **Application Group**: Defines policies for participating organizations,
  specifying details such as:
  - **Organization Name**
  - **Policies**:
    - **Admin**: Roles allow users to modify configurations.
    - **Endorsement**: Policies require transaction approvals from specific
      peers.
    - **Readers and Writers**: Policies define access to channel data.
- **Orderer Group**: Configures the ordering service responsible for transaction
  finalization. Settings include:
  - **Batch Timeout**: Determines the time before transactions are grouped into
    a block.
  - **Max Messages Per Batch**: Controls block size.
- **Consensus Type**: Typically `etcdraft`, a Raft-based ordering service.

#### Network governance and security

Hyperledger Fabric networks require robust security and governance mechanisms:

- **Membership Service Provider (MSP)**: Controls identity verification and
  authentication, ensuring only authorized participants can access the network.
- **Root Certificates and TLS Certificates**: Define trusted entities for secure
  communication.
- **Endorsement Policies**: Determine how transactions are validated across
  organizations, enforcing compliance and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Block Validation Policies**: Ensure the integrity and security of the
  distributed ledger, maintaining network trustworthiness.
