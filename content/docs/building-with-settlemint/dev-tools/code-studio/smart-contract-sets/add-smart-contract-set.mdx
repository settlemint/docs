Smart contract sets allow you to incorporate **business logic** into your application by deploying smart contracts that run on the blockchain. You can add a smart contract set via different methods as part of your development workflow.

<Callout type="info">
  You must have an existing application before you add a smart contract set.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    <Steps>
      ### Navigate to Application
      Navigate to the **application** where you want to add the smart contract set.

      ### Open Dev Tools
      Open **Dev tools** and click on **Add a Dev tool**.

      ![Dev tools](../../../../../img/smart-contract-sets/empty-dev-tools.png)

      ### Select Code Studio
      Select **Code Studio** as the Dev tool type.

      ![Select Code Studio](../../../../../img/smart-contract-sets/select-code-studio.png)

      ### Choose Smart Contract Set
      Then choose **Smart Contract Set**.

      ![Select Smart Contract Set](../../../../../img/smart-contract-sets/select-smart-contract-set.png)

      ### Pick a Template
      Pick a **template**; the Code Studio will load with your chosen smart contract template.

      ![Select Template](../../../../../img/smart-contract-sets/select-template.png)

      ### Enter Details
      Click **Continue** to enter details such as the Dev tool name, user, and deployment plan.

      ![Click Continue](../../../../../img/smart-contract-sets/click-continue.png)

      ### Confirm
      Confirm the resource cost and click **Confirm** to add the smart contract set.
    </Steps>

    You can now further configure and eventually deploy your smart contracts.

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First, ensure you are authenticated:

    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    You can create a smart contract set either on the platform or locally:

    ### Create on Platform

    Then create a smart contract set with the following command (refer to the
    [CLI docs](/building-with-settlemint/15_dev-tools/1_SDK.md) for more details):

    ```bash
    settlemint platform create smart-contract-set <tool-name> \
      --application <application-name> \
      --template <template-name> \
      --deployment-plan <deployment-plan>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    settlemint platform create smart-contract-set my-scset \
      --application my-app \
      --template default \
      --deployment-plan starter
    ```

    ### Working with Smart Contract Sets Locally

    You can also work with smart contract sets in your local development environment. This is useful for development and testing before deploying to the platform.

    To create a smart contract set locally:

    ```bash
    # Create a new smart contract set
    settlemint scs create

    # You'll see the SettleMint ASCII art and then be prompted:
    ✔ What is the name of your new SettleMint project? my awesome project

    # Choose from available templates:
    ❯ ERC20 token
      Empty typescript
      Empty typescript with PDC
      ERC1155 token
      ERC20 token with crowdsale mechanism
      ERC20 token with MetaTx
      ERC721
      # ... and more
    ```

    Once created, you can use these commands to work with your local smart contract set:

    ```bash
    settlemint scs -h  # Show all available commands

    # Main commands:
    settlemint scs create        # Create a new smart contract set
    settlemint scs foundry      # Foundry commands for building and testing
    settlemint scs hardhat      # Hardhat commands for building, testing and deploying
    settlemint scs subgraph    # Commands for managing TheGraph subgraphs
    ```

    The scaffolded project includes everything you need to start developing smart contracts:
    - Contract templates
    - Testing framework
    - Deployment scripts
    - Development tools configuration

    ### Managing Platform Smart Contract Sets

    Manage your platform smart contract sets with:

    ```bash
    # List smart contract sets
    settlemint platform list smart-contract-sets --application <application-name>

    # Read smart contract set details
    settlemint platform read smart-contract-set <smart-contract-set-name>

    # Delete a smart contract set
    settlemint platform delete smart-contract-set <smart-contract-set-name>
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    You can also add a smart contract set programmatically using the JS SDK. The API follows the same pattern as for applications and blockchain networks:

    ```typescript
    import { createSettleMintClient } from '@settlemint/sdk-js';

    const client = createSettleMintClient({
      accessToken: process.env.SETTLEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
      instance: 'https://console.settlemint.com'
    });

    // Create a Smart Contract Set
    const createSmartContractSet = async () => {
      const result = await client.smartContractSet.create({
        applicationUniqueName: "your-app",        // Your application unique name
        name: "my-smart-contract-set",            // The smart contract set name
        template: "default"                       // Template to use (choose from available templates)
      });
      console.log('Smart Contract Set created:', result);
    };

    // List Smart Contract Sets
    const listSmartContractSets = async () => {
      const sets = await client.smartContractSet.list("your-app");
      console.log('Smart Contract Sets:', sets);
    };

    // Read Smart Contract Set details
    const readSmartContractSet = async () => {
      const details = await client.smartContractSet.read("smart-contract-set-unique-name");
      console.log('Smart Contract Set details:', details);
    };

    // Delete a Smart Contract Set
    const deleteSmartContractSet = async () => {
      await client.smartContractSet.delete("smart-contract-set-unique-name");
      console.log('Smart Contract Set deleted');
    };
    ```
