Deploying frontend applications or custom backend services on SettleMint can be
done through custom deployments, which allow you to run containerized
applications using your own Docker images. This enables seamless integration of
user interfaces, REST APIs, microservices, or other utilities directly within
the blockchain-powered environment of your application.

The typical use cases include hosting React/Vue/Next.js-based UIs, creating
custom indexers or oracles, exposing specialized API services, or deploying
off-chain business logic in containerized environments. These deployments are
sandboxed, stateless, and run in secure, managed infrastructure, making them
suitable for both development and production.

To get started, you'll first need to containerize your application (if not
already done) and push the image to a container registry—this can be Docker Hub,
GitHub Container Registry, or a private registry. The image must be built for
AMD architecture, as the SettleMint infrastructure currently supports AMD-based
workloads.

Once your image is ready, you can initiate a custom deployment through the
platform UI, CLI, or SDK. You'll provide the container image path, optional
environment variables, deployment region, and resource configurations. After the
container spins up successfully, your service will be publicly accessible via
the auto-assigned endpoint. For frontend apps, this can act as your live
production URL.

For applications requiring a custom domain, SettleMint allows you to bind domain
names to the deployed container. You can configure the domain in the platform
and then update your DNS records accordingly. The platform supports both ALIAS
records for top-level domains and CNAME records for subdomains. SSL/TLS
certificates are automatically handled unless you opt for a custom cert setup.

Once the deployment is live, you can manage it using the custom deployment
dashboard in the platform. This includes editing environment variables,
restarting the container, updating the image version, checking logs, and
monitoring availability. You can also script or automate these tasks using the
SDK or CLI as needed.

A few considerations: custom deployments are stateless by design, so any data
you want to persist should be stored using services like Hasura for off-chain
database functionality or MinIO/IPFS for file storage. The container's
filesystem is read-only to enhance security and portability. Additionally, apps
won't run with root privileges, so ensure your container adheres to standard
non-root user practices.

This feature is especially useful when you need to tightly couple your UI or
service logic with the on-chain components—enabling a clean, integrated workflow
for dApps, admin consoles, analytics dashboards, API bridges, or token utility
services. It offers flexibility without leaving the SettleMint ecosystem, all
while adhering to scalable and cloud-native design principles.

## How to use custom deployments to host application frontend or other custom services in SettleMint platform

A custom deployment allows you to deploy your own Docker images, such as
frontend applications, on the SettleMint platform. This feature provides
flexibility for integrating custom solutions within your blockchain-based
applications.

    SettleMint platform create custom-deployment my-deployment \
      --application my-app \
      --image-repository registry.example.com \
      --image-name my-app \
      --image-tag latest \
      --port 3000 \
      --provider gcp \
      --region europe-west1

    # With environment variables
    SettleMint platform create custom-deployment my-deployment \
      --application my-app \
      --image-repository registry.example.com \
      --image-name my-app \

          NODE_ENV: "production"
        }
      });
    };
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## DNS configuration for custom domains

When using custom domains with your custom deployment, you'll need to configure
your DNS settings correctly. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Add custom domain to the SettleMint platform**:

   - Navigate to your custom deployment in the SettleMint platform.
   - In the manage custom deployment menu, click on the edit custom deployment
     action.
   - Locate the custom domains configuration section.
   - Enter your desired custom domain (e.g., example.com for top-level domain or
     app.example.com for subdomain).
   - Save the changes to update your custom deployment settings.

2. **Obtain your application's hostname**: After adding your custom domain, the
   SettleMint platform will provide you with an ALIAS (for top-level domains) or
   CNAME (for subdomains) record. This can be found in the "connect" tab of your
   custom deployment.

3. **Access your domain's DNS settings**: Log in to your domain registrar or DNS
   provider's control panel.

4. **Configure DNS records**:

   For Top-Level Domains (e.g., example.com):

   - Remove any existing A and AAAA records for the domain you're configuring.
   - Remove any existing A and AAAA records for the www domain (e.g.,
     www.example.com) if you're using it.

   ```
   ALIAS example.com gke-europe.settlemint.com
   ALIAS www.example.com gke-europe.settlemint.com
   ```

   For Subdomains (e.g., app.example.com):

   ```
   CNAME app.example.com gke-europe.settlemint.com
   ```

5. **Set TTL (Time to Live)**:

   - Set a lower TTL (e.g., 300 seconds) initially to allow for quicker
     propagation.
   - You can increase it later for better caching (e.g., 3600 seconds).

6. **Verify DNS propagation**:

   - Use online DNS lookup tools to check if your DNS changes have propagated.
   - Note that DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, although it's often much
     quicker.

7. **SSL/TLS configuration**:
   - The SettleMint platform typically handles SSL/TLS certificates
     automatically for both top-level domains and subdomains.
   - If you need to use your own certificates, please contact us for assistance
     and further instructions.

Note: The configuration process is similar for both top-level domains and
subdomains. The main difference lies in the type of DNS record you create (ALIAS
for top-level domains, CNAME for subdomains) and whether you need to remove
existing records.

## Manage custom deployments

<Tabs items={['platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="platform UI">
    1. Navigate to your application's **custom deployments** section
    2. Click on a deployment to:
       - View deployment status and details
       - Manage environment variables
       - Configure custom domains
       - View logs
       - Check endpoints
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List custom deployments
    SettleMint platform list custom-deployments --application my-app

    # Get deployment details
    SettleMint platform read custom-deployment my-deployment

    # Restart deployment
    SettleMint platform restart custom-deployment my-deployment

    # Edit deployment
    SettleMint platform edit custom-deployment my-deployment \
      --container-image registry.example.com/my-app:v2
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List deployments
    const listDeployments = async () => {
      const deployments = await client.customDeployment.list("my-app");
    };

    // Get deployment details
    const getDeployment = async () => {
      const deployment = await client.customDeployment.read("deployment-unique-name");
    };

    // Restart deployment
    const restartDeployment = async () => {
      await client.customDeployment.restart("deployment-unique-name");
    };

    // Edit deployment
    const editDeployment = async () => {
      await client.customDeployment.edit("deployment-unique-name", {
        imageTag: "v2"
      });
    };
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Limitations and considerations

When using custom deployment, keep the following limitations in mind:

1. **No root user privileges**: Your application will run without root user
   privileges for security reasons.

2. **Read-only filesystem**: The filesystem is read-only. For data persistence,
   consider using:

   - Hasura: A GraphQL engine that provides a scalable database solution. See
     [Hasura](/building-with-settlemint/hasura-backend-as-a-service).
   - Other external services: Depending on your specific needs, you may use
     other cloud-based storage or database services

3. **Stateless applications**: Your applications should be designed to be
   stateless. This ensures better scalability and reliability in a cloud
   environment.

4. **Use AMD-based images**: Currently, our platform supports AMD-based
   container images. Ensure your Docker images are built for AMD architecture to
   guarantee smooth compatibility with our infrastructure.

## Best practices

- Design your applications to be stateless and horizontally scalable
- Use environment variables for configuration to make your deployments more
  flexible
- Implement proper logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring
- Regularly update your container images to include the latest security patches

Custom deployment offers a powerful way to extend the capabilities of your
blockchain solutions on the SettleMint platform. By following these guidelines
and best practices, you can seamlessly integrate your custom applications into
your blockchain ecosystem.
