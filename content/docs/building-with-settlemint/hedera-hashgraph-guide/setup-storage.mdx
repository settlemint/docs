  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>

To integrate off-chain file storage into your blockchain application, you can configure either IPFS (for decentralized content addressing) or MinIO (an S3-compatible private storage layer) through the SettleMint platform. Both options serve different use cases‚ÄîIPFS excels in immutability and decentralized access, while S3-style storage is better for secure, private, and high-performance file delivery.

To get started, navigate to the relevant application in your SettleMint workspace and open the Storage section from the left-hand menu. Click Add Storage, which opens a configuration form. Choose the storage type‚Äîeither IPFS for decentralized or MinIO for private object storage. Assign a name and configure your deployment settings like region, provider, and resource pack. Once confirmed, the storage service will be deployed and available for use.

Once provisioned, you can access and manage your storage instance from the Manage Storage section. Here, you will be able to view the storage endpoint, health status, and metadata configuration. If using IPFS, you‚Äôll be interacting with content hashes (CIDs), while MinIO offers an S3-compatible interface where files are stored under buckets and can be accessed via signed URLs.

Using the SettleMint SDK or CLI, developers will be able to list, query, and manage storage instances programmatically. The SDK provides a typed interface to connect, upload, retrieve, and delete files. For example, the @settlemint/sdk-ipfs package allows seamless pinning and retrieval of files using CIDs. Similarly, @settlemint/sdk-minio wraps around common S3 operations like uploading files, generating expirable download URLs, and managing buckets.

Depending on your use case, both IPFS and MinIO can serve as complementary layers. For public-facing and immutable content‚Äîsuch as NFT metadata, DAO governance artifacts, or verifiable documents‚ÄîIPFS is well suited. For private, regulated, or access-controlled files‚Äîlike KYC documents, user uploads, admin reports, and internal metadata‚ÄîMinIO offers a robust alternative with access control and performance guarantees.

In practice, a dApp may use both systems in tandem: the file is stored in S3/MinIO for fast access and usability, while its content hash is stored on IPFS (and optionally, linked on-chain) to provide tamper-proof guarantees and content validation. This hybrid model ensures performance, security, and decentralization where it matters most.

Once storage is connected, users and developers can begin uploading files via frontend integrations, backend scripts, or SDK calls. Content uploaded to IPFS will return a CID, which can be persisted on-chain or referenced in subgraphs and APIs. Files on S3/MinIO can be secured using signed URLs or policies, making them suitable for user role‚Äìbased access or limited-time file sharing.

## Off-chain File Storage Use Cases in Blockchain Applications

Blockchain applications often require storing documents, images, videos, or
metadata off-chain due to cost, performance, or privacy reasons. Two common
approaches are:

- **IPFS**: A decentralized, content-addressed file system ideal for immutable,
  verifiable, and censorship-resistant data.
- **Amazon S3**: A centralized, enterprise-grade storage solution that supports
  private files, fine-grained access control, and fast retrieval.

Below are separate use case tables for each.

## üåê IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS is a decentralized protocol for storing and sharing files in a peer-to-peer
network. Files are addressed by their content hash (CID), ensuring immutability
and verification.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 is a centralized cloud storage platform that offers speed,
scalability, and rich security features. It is especially suitable for private
or enterprise-grade applications.

## Summary: When to Use Which?

| Use Case Pattern                      | Recommended Storage |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Public, immutable content             | **IPFS**            |
| Verifiable, on-chain linked data      | **IPFS**            |
| Private or role-based content         | **S3**              |
| Fast real-time access (UI/media)      | **S3**              |
| Hybrid (IPFS for hash, S3 for access) | **Both**            |

Each system has unique advantages. For truly decentralized applications where
transparency and verifiability matter, IPFS is a natural fit. For operational
scalability, secure access, and enterprise-grade needs, S3 provides a reliable
foundation.

In hybrid dApps, combining both ensures performance without compromising on
decentralization.
