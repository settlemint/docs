To set up a Graph middleware in SettleMint, you’ll begin by ensuring that your
application and blockchain node are ready. The Graph middleware will serve as
your read layer, enabling powerful querying of on-chain events using a GraphQL
interface. This is particularly useful when you want to retrieve and analyze
historical smart contract data in a structured, filterable format.

First, you’ll need to add the middleware itself. Head to the Middleware section
inside your application on the SettleMint platform. Click Add a middleware, and
select Graph as the type. Assign a name, pick the blockchain node (where your
smart contract is deployed), configure the deployment settings, and confirm.
This action will provision the underlying infrastructure required to run your
subgraph.

Next, you will create the subgraph package in Code Studio. The subgraph folder
contains all the code and configuration required for indexing and querying your
smart contract’s events. You will define a subgraph.config.json file that lists
the network (via chain ID), your contract address, and the data sources (i.e.,
smart contracts and associated modules) that the subgraph will index.

Inside the datasources folder, you will create a userdata.yaml manifest file
that outlines the smart contract address, ABI path, start block, and
event-handler mappings. This YAML file connects emitted events like
ProfileCreated, ProfileUpdated, and ProfileDeleted with specific AssemblyScript
functions that define how the data is processed and stored.

You will then define the schema in userdata.gql.json. This is your GraphQL
schema, which defines the structure of your indexed data. Entities like
UserProfile, ProfileCreated, and ProfileUpdated are defined here, each with the
fields to be stored and queried later via GraphQL.

Once the schema is ready, you will implement the mapping logic in userdata.ts,
which listens for emitted events and updates the subgraph’s entities
accordingly. A helper file inside the fetch directory will provide utility logic
to create or retrieve entities without code repetition.

After writing all files, you will run the codegen, build, and deploy scripts
using the provided task buttons in Code Studio. These scripts will compile your
schema and mapping into WebAssembly (WASM), bundle it for deployment, and push
it to the Graph middleware node.

Once deployed, you will be able to open the Graph middleware’s GraphQL explorer
and run queries against your indexed data. You can query by ID or use the plural
form to get a list of entries. This enables your application or analytics layer
to fetch historical state data in a fast and reliable way.

## How to setup Graph Middleware and API Portal in SettleMint platform

Middleware acts as a bridge between your blockchain network and applications,
providing essential services like data indexing, API access, and event
monitoring. Before adding middleware, ensure you have an application and
blockchain node in place.

## How to Add Middleware

## Subgraph folder structure in Code Studio IDE

```
subgraph/
│
├── subgraph.config.json
│
├── datasources/
│   ├── mycontract.gql.json
│   ├── mycontract.ts
│   └── mycontract.yaml
│
└── fetch/
└── mycontract.ts
```

### 1. subgraph.config.json

This file contains the global configuration for your subgraph. It specifies:

- output: The directory where generated files will be stored.
- chain: The blockchain network to index (e.g., localhost, rinkeby, mainnet).
- datasources: An array listing each contract datasource that the subgraph will
  index. Each entry defines the contract address, the block number to start
  indexing from, and the module (folder) containing the datasource’s files.

### 2. datasources/mycontract.gql.json

This file is a JSON representation of your GraphQL schema. It defines the
entities that the subgraph will index and store in the Graph Node’s database.

### 3. datasources/mycontract.yaml

This YAML manifest configures how the subgraph ingests on-chain data from your
contract. It specifies the contract address, ABI, event handlers, entities, and
mapping file. Be very careful about YAML structure, any deviation or missing
indentation can cause errors.

### 4. datasources/mycontract.ts

This AssemblyScript file contains the logic that listens for events and writes
data into the Graph’s store by updating entities.

### 5. fetch/mycontract.ts

This file provides a reusable function to fetch or create MyEntity instances. It
helps avoid repetitive code in your mapping file.

## Subgraph deployment process

### 1. Collect constants needed

Find the chain ID of the network from igntition>deployments folder name
(chain-ID) or from the Platform UI at Blockchain Networks > Selcted Network >
Details page, it will be something like **47440**.

Locate the contract address, deployed contract address is stored in
deployed_addresses.json file located in igntition>deployments folder.

### 2. Building subgraph.config.json file

```json
{
  "output": "generated/scs.",
  "chain": "44819",
  "datasources": [
    {
      "name": "UserData",
      "address": "0x8b1544B8e0d21aef575Ce51e0c243c2D73C3C7B9",
      "startBlock": 0,
      "module": ["userdata"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3 Create userdata.yaml file

```yaml
- kind: ethereum/contract
  name: { id }
  network: { chain }
  source:
    address: "{address}"
    abi: UserData
    startBlock: { startBlock }
  mapping:
    kind: ethereum/events
    apiVersion: 0.0.5
    language: wasm/assemblyscript
    entities:
      - UserProfile
      - ProfileCreated
      - ProfileUpdated
      - ProfileDeleted
    abis:
      - name: UserData
        file: "{root}/out/UserData.sol/UserData.json"
    eventHandlers:
      - event: ProfileCreated(indexed uint256,string,string,uint8,string,bool)
        handler: handleProfileCreated
      - event: ProfileUpdated(indexed uint256,string,string,uint8,string,bool)
        handler: handleProfileUpdated
      - event: ProfileDeleted(indexed uint256)
        handler: handleProfileDeleted
    file: { file }
```

### 4. Create userdata.gql.json file

```
[
  {
    "name": "UserProfile",
    "description": "Represents the current state of a user's profile.",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "id", "type": "ID!" },
      { "name": "name", "type": "String!" },
      { "name": "email", "type": "String!" },
      { "name": "age", "type": "Int!" },
      { "name": "country", "type": "String!" },
      { "name": "isKYCApproved", "type": "Boolean!" },
      { "name": "isDeleted", "type": "Boolean!" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "ProfileCreated",
    "description": "Captures the event when a new user profile is created.",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "id", "type": "ID!" },
      { "name": "userId", "type": "BigInt!" },
      { "name": "userProfile", "type": "UserProfile!" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "ProfileUpdated",
    "description": "Captures the event when an existing user profile is updated.",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "id", "type": "ID!" },
      { "name": "userId", "type": "BigInt!" },
      { "name": "userProfile", "type": "UserProfile!" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "ProfileDeleted",
    "description": "Captures the event when a user profile is soft-deleted.",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "id", "type": "ID!" },
      { "name": "userId", "type": "BigInt!" },
      { "name": "userProfile", "type": "UserProfile!" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 5. Create userdata.ts file

```ts
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import {
  ProfileCreated as ProfileCreatedEvent,
  ProfileUpdated as ProfileUpdatedEvent,
  ProfileDeleted as ProfileDeletedEvent,
} from "../../generated/userdata/UserData";
import {
  UserProfile,
  ProfileCreated,
  ProfileUpdated,
  ProfileDeleted,
} from "../../generated/schema";
import { fetchUserProfile } from "../fetch/userdata";

export function handleProfileCreated(event: ProfileCreatedEvent): void {
  // Generate a unique event ID using transaction hash and log index
  let id = event.transaction.hash.toHex() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString();
  let entity = new ProfileCreated(id);
  entity.userId = event.params.userId;

  // Fetch or create the UserProfile entity
  let profile = fetchUserProfile(event.params.userId);
  profile.name = event.params.name;
  profile.email = event.params.email;
  profile.age = event.params.age;
  profile.country = event.params.country;
  profile.isKYCApproved = event.params.isKYCApproved;
  profile.isDeleted = false;
  profile.save();

  // Link the event entity to the user profile and save
  entity.userProfile = profile.id;
  entity.save();
}

export function handleProfileUpdated(event: ProfileUpdatedEvent): void {
  let id = event.transaction.hash.toHex() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString();
  let entity = new ProfileUpdated(id);
  entity.userId = event.params.userId;

  // Retrieve and update the existing UserProfile entity
  let profile = fetchUserProfile(event.params.userId);
  profile.name = event.params.name;
  profile.email = event.params.email;
  profile.age = event.params.age;
  profile.country = event.params.country;
  profile.isKYCApproved = event.params.isKYCApproved;
  profile.isDeleted = false;
  profile.save();

  entity.userProfile = profile.id;
  entity.save();
}

export function handleProfileDeleted(event: ProfileDeletedEvent): void {
  let id = event.transaction.hash.toHex() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString();
  let entity = new ProfileDeleted(id);
  entity.userId = event.params.userId;

  // Retrieve the UserProfile entity and mark it as deleted
  let profile = fetchUserProfile(event.params.userId);
  profile.isDeleted = true;
  profile.save();

  entity.userProfile = profile.id;
  entity.save();
}
```

### 6. Create another userdata.ts in the fetch folder

```ts
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import { UserProfile } from "../../generated/schema";

/**
 * Fetches a UserProfile entity using the given userId.
 * If it does not exist, a new UserProfile entity is created with default values.
 *
 * @param userId - The user ID as a BigInt.
 * @returns The UserProfile entity.
 */
export function fetchUserProfile(userId: BigInt): UserProfile {
  let id = userId.toString();
  let user = UserProfile.load(id);

  if (!user) {
    user = new UserProfile(id);
    user.name = "";
    user.email = "";
    user.age = 0;
    user.country = "";
    user.isKYCApproved = false;
    user.isDeleted = false;
  }

  return user;
}
```

Run Codegen script

![Graph Codegen](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/graph-codegen.png)

Run Graph Build script

![Graph Build](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/graph-build.png)

Run Graph deploy script

![Graph Deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/graph-deploy.png)

### Why we see a duplicay in the GraphQL schema -

In The Graph’s autogenerated schema, each entity is provided with two types of
queries by default:

- **Single-Entity Query:**  
  `userProfile(id: ID!): UserProfile`  
  _Fetches a single `UserProfile` by its unique ID._

- **Multi-Entity Query:**  
  `userProfiles(...): [UserProfile]`  
  _Fetches a list of `UserProfile` entities, with optional filters to refine the
  results._

Why This Duplication Exists - **Flexibility in Data Access:** By offering both
single-entity and multi-entity queries, The Graph allows you to choose the most
efficient way to access your data. If you know the exact ID, you can use the
single query for a quick lookup. If you need to display or analyze a collection
of records, the multi-entity query is available. - **Optimized Performance:**
Retrieving a specific record via the single-entity query avoids unnecessary
overhead that comes with filtering through a list, ensuring more efficient data
access when the unique identifier is known. - **Catering to Different Use
Cases:** Different parts of your application may require different query types.
Detailed views might need a single record (using userProfile), while list views
benefit from the filtering and pagination offered by userProfiles. -
**Consistency Across the Schema:** Generating both queries for every entity
ensures a consistent API design, which simplifies development by providing a
predictable pattern for data access regardless of the entity.

### Graph Middleware - Querying data

We can query based on the ID
![Graph Query Profile](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/graph-query-profile.png)

Or we can query to return all entries

Congratulations.!!

You have succesfully configured Graph Middleware and deployed subgraphs to
enable smart contractindexing. With this you have both read and write middelware
for your smart contracts. 

This marks the end of the core Web3 development, from
here we will proceed to adding off-chain database and storage options to enable
us to have a holistic backend and storage layer for our application.
