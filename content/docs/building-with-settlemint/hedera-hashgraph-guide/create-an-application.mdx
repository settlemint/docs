To get started on the SettleMint platform, you need to create an organization by going to the homepage or clicking the grid icon, then selecting “Create new organization.” You’ll need to enter a name and complete the billing setup using Stripe to activate it. 

Once your organization is ready, you need to invite your team members by entering their email addresses, selecting their roles, and sending the invitation. After that, you need to create an application within the organization by giving it a name and confirming. 

You can manage your organization and applications from the dashboard—change names, invite more members, or delete resources when needed. You can also create and manage applications using the SDK CLI or SDK JS if you prefer to work programmatically.

## How to create an organization and application in SettleMint platform

An organization is the highest level of hierarchy in SettleMint. It's at this level that you can  create and manage blockchain applications, invite team members to collaborate and manage billing. 

![Organization and Applications](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/organization_and_application.png)

![Add Organization](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-org.png)

You created your first organization when you signed up to use the SettleMint
platform, but you can create as many organizations as you want, e.g. for your
company, departments, teams, clients, etc. Organizations help you structure your
work, manage collaboration, and keep your invoices clearly organized.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-start gap-8">

  <div className="md:w-1/2">
    <h2>Create an Organization</h2>

    Navigate to the <strong>homepage</strong>, or click the <strong>grid icon</strong> in the upper right corner.

    Click <strong>Create new organization</strong>. This opens a form. Follow these steps to create your organization:

    Choose a <strong>name</strong> for your organization. Choose a name that is easily
    recognizable in your dashboards, e.g. your company name, department name, team name, etc.
    You can change the name of your organization at any time.

  </div>
  <div className="md:w-1/2">

  </div>
</div>


<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-start">
  {/* Left Column - Text Content */}
  <div className="flex flex-col justify-start pt-2">
  <p>Enter **billing information**. SettleMint creates a billing account for this
organization. You will be billed monthly for the resources you use within this
organization. Provide your billing details securely via Stripe, with support for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex, to activate your organization. Follow the prompts to complete the setup and gain full access to SettleMint’s blockchain development tools. Ensure all details are accurate to enable a smooth onboarding experience. Your organization is billed monthly, with the invoice dates set for 1st of every month.</p>
  </div>

  {/* Right Column - Image */}
  <div>

  </div>
</div>

 Click **Confirm** to go to the organization dashboard. From here,
you can create your first application in this organization. The dashboard will show you a summary of your
organization's applications, the members in this organization, and a status of
the resource costs for the current month.

When you create an organization, you are the owner, and therefore an
administrator of the organization. This means you can perform all actions within
this organization, with no limitations.

## Invite new organization members

![Invite Members](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/invite-member-to-org.png)

Navigate to the **Members section** of your organization, via the homepage, or
via your organization dashboard.

Follow these steps to invite new members to your organization:

1. Click **Invite new member**.
2. Enter the **email adress** of the person you want to invite.
3. Select their **role**, i.e. whether they will be an administrator or a user.
4. Optionally, you can add a **message** to be included in the invitation email.
5. Click **Confirm** to go to the list of your organization's members. Your
   email invitation has now been sent, and you see in the list that it is
   pending.

## Manage an organization

Navigate to the **organization dashboard**.

Click **Manage organization** to see the available actions. You can only perform
these actions if you have administrator rights for this organization.

- **Change name** - Changes the organization name without any further impact.
- **Delete organization** - Removes the organization from the platform.

On Organization Dashboard
- See all applications in that organization.
- See all members of the organization
- See all the internal applications and clients if in partner mode


:::warning Warning

You can only delete an organization when it has no applications related to it.
Applications have to be deleted one by one, once all their related resources
(e.g. networks, nodes, smart contract sets, etc.) have been deleted.

:::

## Create an application

An application is the context in which you organize your networks, nodes, smart
contract sets and any other related blockchain resource.

<Callout type="info">
  You will always need to create an application before you can deploy or join
  networks, and add nodes.
