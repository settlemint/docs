  Summary
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
    To send transactions on a blockchain, you need a private key (with enough
    funds for gas for networks with a fee). You can create and manage private
    keys directly within SettleMint using ECDSA, HD ECDSA, or HSM key types.
    <br></br>
    After creating a key, it must be attached to at least one node to enable
    transaction signing, this is critical for smart contract deployment. Without
    it, the deployment will fail.
    <br></br>
    SettleMint also offers user wallets, a scalable solution that generates
    wallets from a single HD ECDSA 256 key. Each user gets a unique address for
    privacy and parallel transaction support. You can create user wallets once
    your HD key is deployed and running, and fund them as needed for gas-based
    transactions.

## How to add private keys and user wallets in SettleMint platform

# Private keys

Sending transactions on a blockchain network requires two essential components:
a private key to cryptographically sign your transactions, and sufficient funds
in your wallet to cover the associated gas fees. Without either element,
transaction execution will fail.

<br> </br>
While you can use external private keys created with tools like MetaMask or
other wallet solutions, **SettleMint offers a more integrated approach**. The
platform provides built-in functionality to **create and manage private keys
directly within your environment**, eliminating the need for external wallet
management.
<br> </br>
When you deploy a blockchain node, it contains a signing proxy that captures the
eth_sendTransaction call, uses the appropriate key from the private key section
to sign it, and sends it onwards to the blockchain node. You can use this proxy
directly via the node's JSON-RPC endpoints
([JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)) and via
tools like Hardhat ([HardHat
RPC](https://hardhat.org/config/#json-rpc-based-networks)) configured to use the
"remote" default option for signing.

## Create a private key

To add a private key in the SettleMint platform, navigate to the private keys
section and click create a private key. You'll be prompted to select the type of
private key, ECDSA P256, HD ECDSA P256, or HSM ECDSA P256.

    Navigate to your **application**, click **private keys** in the left navigation, and then click **create a private key**. This opens a form.

    Follow these steps to create the private key:

    1. Choose a **private key type**:
       - **Accessible ECDSA P256**: Standard Ethereum-style private keys with exposed mnemonic
       - **HD ECDSA P256**: Hierarchical Deterministic keys for advanced key management
       - **HSM ECDSA P256**: Hardware Security Module protected keys for maximum security

    2. Choose a **name** for your private key
    3. Select the **nodes** on which you want the key to be active
    4. Click **confirm** to create the key

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # Create Accessible ECDSA P256 key

## Attaching private keys to blockchain nodes (transaction signer)

![Attach private key to node](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-key-to-node.png)

Every smart contract deployment involves a transaction that must be signed by an
authorized account. This signature proves that the transaction came from a valid
identity and permits it to be processed by the network. When using SettleMint,
deploying a smart contract via the platform UI or SDK initiates an
eth_sendTransaction call, which must be signed by a private key. However, nodes
cannot inherently sign transactions unless a key has been explicitly activated
and attached to them.

If no private key is attached to the node involved in the deployment, the
process will halt at the signing step. The platform will not be able to
authorize the deployment transaction, resulting in a failed operation. This
makes key-to-node assignment a required step in any production or test setup
involving deployment, contract interactions, or any state-changing blockchain
transaction.

**How to attach a private key to a node**

1. Go to the private keys section of your SettleMint workspace.
2. Click on the private key (e.g., "Deployer") you wish to use for signing
   transactions.
3. Navigate to the nodes tab of that private key's page.
4. You'll see a list of available nodes in your network (validator and RPC
   nodes).
5. Select the nodes that should use this key for transaction signing. These will
   usually be RPC nodes or validators depending on your setup.
6. Once selected, the key becomes active on these nodes and is used for signing
   all outgoing transactions initiated from the platform.

**Best practices and nuances**

1. Always attach the key to at least one node before deploying a smart contract.
   In most cases, attaching it to an RPC node is sufficient.
2. Avoid attaching the same key to multiple nodes unless required, to reduce the
   risk of key misuse or unnecessary transaction replay.
3. Ensure the private key has sufficient funds (ETH or native token) to pay for
   gas costs associated with contract deployment if working on public chains or
   non-zero gas fee networks.
4. For security reasons, only assign signing permissions to nodes you trust and
   control.
5. Consider using an HD key if you want to manage multiple identities derived
   from the same mnemonic, but ensure the correct derivation path is used.

## Manage private keys

<Tabs items={['SDK CLI', 'Platform UI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    1. Navigate to your application's **private keys** section
    2. Click on a private key to:
       - View details and status
       - Manage node associations
       - Check balances
       - Fund the key
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List all private keys
    settlemint platform list private-keys --application <app-name>

    # View specific key details
    settlemint platform read private-key <private-key-unique-name>

    # Restart a private key
    settlemint platform restart private-key <private-key-unique-name>
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List private keys
    const listKeys = async () => {
      const keys = await client.privateKey.list("your-app-name");
    };

    // Get key details
    const getKey = async () => {
      const key = await client.privateKey.read("key-unique-name");
    };

    // Restart key
    const restartKey = async () => {
      await client.privateKey.restart("key-unique-name");
    };
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Fund the private key

For networks that require gas to perform a transaction, your private key should
contain enough funds to cover the gas price.

<Callout type="info">
For Hedera Testnet, you can get free test HBAR from the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com).
This will provide you with enough test HBAR to cover transaction fees during development and testing.

1. Visit [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com)
2. Create an account if you don't have one
3. Navigate to the Testnet Faucet section
4. Copy your SettleMint wallet address (in 0x format)
5. Paste it into the faucet form
6. Submit to receive your test HBAR (typically 10,000 test HBAR)

The HBAR balance will appear in your SettleMint wallet once the transaction is
processed.

</Callout>

For funding your wallet:

1. Click the **private key** in the overview to see detailed information
2. Open the **balances tab**
3. Use the public address of the wallet which you want to fund for sending
   tokens/currency to it.

<Callout type="info">
  Ensure your private key has sufficient funds before attempting transactions on
  networks that require gas fees.

## User wallets

SettleMint's **user wallets** feature offers a production-ready solution for
managing infinite wallets with efficiency and scalability. This tool empowers
users with seamless wallet generation, ensuring **cost-effective management**
and eliminating additional expenses. By generating **unique addresses for each
user**, privacy is significantly enhanced, while improved performance ensures
faster, parallel transaction processing through separate nonces. User wallet
also simplifies wallet recovery since all wallets are derived from a single
master key. User wallets use the same signing proxy to sign transactions with
the corresponding user private key.

## Create and setup user wallets

To set up your user wallets, navigate to your application, click **private
keys** in the left navigation, and then click **create a private key**. This
opens a form.

Select **HD ECDSA P256** as the private key type then, enter a **name** for your
deployment. You can also select the nodes or load balancers on which you want to
enable the user wallets. You can change this later if you want to use your user
wallets on a different node. Click **confirm** to deploy the wallet.

## Difference between ECDSA and HD ECDSA key and why we do not see user wallets in simple ECDSA keys.

A simple ECDSA key is just one key pair , a private key and its corresponding
public key. It can be used to sign transactions and control a blockchain
address, but it’s standalone. There’s no built-in mechanism to derive more keys
from it. If you want multiple accounts, you’d need to manually generate and
store each key separately. An HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet, on the
other hand, starts from a single master seed. From this seed, it can generate an
entire tree of ECDSA key pairs in a structured and repeatable way. This system
follows the BIP-32 standard and includes concepts like key derivation paths and
chain codes.

<br />
The reason HD wallets are suitable for managing wallets is that they support
deterministic key generation. You can recreate the full wallet from just the
seed phrase. Each new account or address is simply a derived key from a known
path. This is efficient and secure, and it also simplifies backup and recovery.
Simple ECDSA keys lack this structure. They are isolated, and generating
multiple keys would require managing each one individually. This doesn’t scale
for wallets, especially those that require many accounts, addresses, or
identities. That’s why HD ECDSA key systems are preferred in wallet
implementation.

When your deployment status is **running**, you can click on it to check the
details. You can see the mnemonic from which the user wallets are generated
under **key material**. Upon initialization, the user wallets section is empty.
To create your first user wallet, click on **create a user wallet**.

Remember that for networks that require gas to perform a transaction, the user
wallet should contain enough funds to cover the gas price. You can fund it using
the address displayed in the list.
