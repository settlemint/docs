## Using Hedera with EVM Compatibility

When working with Hedera through SettleMint, you'll be using Hedera's EVM compatibility layer. This means:

- Your smart contracts are written in **standard Solidity**
- Addresses follow the Ethereum **0x format** rather than Hedera's native 0.0.x format
- You can use **SettleMint's Code Studio IDE** and existing smart contract templates directly with Hedera
- Deploy using **SettleMint's built-in tools** (Task Manager, SDK, CLI) with the same workflow as other EVM chains

This EVM compatibility layer acts as a bridge between Ethereum's developer experience and Hedera's performance advantages, allowing you to deploy the same contracts you'd use on Ethereum while benefiting from Hedera's speed and lower costs.

<Callout type="info">
While working through the SettleMint platform, you don't need to worry about the complexities of Hedera's native format - all conversion between EVM and native Hedera formats is handled automatically.

## What is Hedera?

Hedera is an enterprise-grade public network that offers the security of blockchain with significantly faster transaction speeds and lower costs. Built on the hashgraph consensus algorithm, Hedera provides a foundation for developers to create decentralized applications with predictable performance.

### Key Features

- **High Throughput**: Processes thousands of transactions per second
- **Fast Finality**: Transactions finalize in 3-5 seconds
- **Low, Predictable Fees**: Transaction costs significantly lower than traditional blockchains
- **Enterprise Governance**: Governed by a council of global organizations
- **Energy Efficient**: Uses proof-of-stake with minimal environmental impact

For more information, please refer the [Hedera Documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera)
## Hedera's EVM Compatibility

Hedera offers full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enabling developers to deploy and interact with smart contracts using familiar Solidity code and Ethereum tools. This compatibility layer provides the best of both worlds:

- **Ethereum Developer Experience**: Use standard Solidity and existing Ethereum tools
- **Hedera's Performance Benefits**: Leverage high throughput and low fees
- **No Lock-in**: Your smart contracts work across EVM-compatible chains

## SettleMint's Hedera Integration

SettleMint has built a complete, managed infrastructure layer that makes developing on Hedera's EVM as simple as developing on any other EVM chain:

- **Fully Managed Infrastructure**: No need to configure complex Hedera components
- **Zero-Setup JSON-RPC Relay**: Direct connection to Hedera through standard Ethereum interfaces
- **Built-in Mirror Nodes**: Query blockchain data through familiar APIs

<Callout type="info">
SettleMint handles all the complexity of connecting to Hedera behind the scenes, allowing you to focus on your application's business logic rather than infrastructure.
</Callout>

## Transaction Flow: How It Works

When you deploy or interact with a smart contract on Hedera through SettleMint, here's what happens:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Developer
    participant SettleMint
    participant JSON-RPC Relay
    participant Hedera EVM
    participant Hedera Consensus
    
    Developer->>SettleMint: Deploy Solidity Contract
    SettleMint->>JSON-RPC Relay: Submit EVM Transaction
    JSON-RPC Relay->>Hedera EVM: Translate to Hedera Format
    Hedera EVM->>Hedera Consensus: Process Transaction
    Hedera Consensus-->>Hedera EVM: Confirm Transaction
    Hedera EVM-->>JSON-RPC Relay: Return EVM Format Result
    JSON-RPC Relay-->>SettleMint: Return Transaction Status
    SettleMint-->>Developer: Display Success/Contract Address
    
    note over JSON-RPC Relay: Handles All Format Conversion
    note over Hedera Consensus: 3-5 Second Finality
```

This seamless flow enables you to use standard Web3 libraries, frameworks, and tools while benefiting from Hedera's performance and security.

## Networks Available in SettleMint

SettleMint provides access to both Hedera networks:

- **Hedera Mainnet**: Production environment with real HBAR tokens
- **Hedera Testnet**: Development environment with free test HBAR

<Callout type="tip">
For development and testing, always start with Testnet. You can get free test HBAR from the Hedera Portal at [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com).
</Callout>

## Getting Started with Hedera on SettleMint

To begin building on Hedera through SettleMint:

1. [Set up your SettleMint workspace and application](/documentation/building-with-settlemint/hedera-hashgraph-guide/create-an-application)
2. Configure your Hedera network connection
3. Add private keys and obtain HBAR
4. Deploy your smart contracts with familiar tools

The subsequent guides will walk you through each step in detail.

<Callout type="warning">
When deploying your first contract to Hedera, you might experience slightly longer deployment times than on other EVM chains. This is normal due to the conversion between EVM and Hedera's native transaction format.
