title: Tokenized Deposits

Tokenized deposits are digital tokens issued by banks that represent a claim on
a traditional deposit (similar to stablecoins, but issued within regulated bank
balance sheets). They combine the trust of bank deposits with the efficiency of
blockchain. Use cases for tokenized deposits include:

- **Instant Interbank Payments**: Banks can use tokenized deposits as a
  settlement asset for interbank transfers, drastically speeding up payment
  networks. Instead of sending money through ACH or wire (which cut off at
  certain hours), a bank can transfer a tokenized deposit to another bank on a
  shared ledger and settle the payment instantly, 24/7. Citi’s recent launch of
  tokenized deposit services shows this potential – it enabled 24/7, “always-on
  cross-border liquidity and payments” between its branches for
  multimillion-dollar transactions. By adopting tokenized deposits, banks
  collectively could reduce the dependency on central bank operating hours for
  settlement, improving liquidity management and reducing payment delays for
  large-value transfers.
- **Programmable & Consumer-Friendly Deposits**: With tokenized deposits, banks
  can create customer-centric deposit products that are more flexible and
  functional. For example, a bank could offer a digital deposit account where
  the balance is a token that a customer can program with rules: automatically
  pay certain bills on due dates, sweep excess balance into a savings token, or
  even trigger small investments. Smart contracts tied to tokenized deposits
  allow for features like automated interest payments (interest could be
  calculated daily and paid out as tokens without manual batch processing). They
  also enable new services like escrow accounts (funds held as tokens that
  release upon conditions) or micro-loans/overdraft protection that execute via
  code. All of this enhances the customer experience, giving clients faster and
  more versatile control over their funds while the bank ensures security and
  compliance in the background.
- **Interbank Lending & Liquidity**: Tokenized deposits can be used in interbank
  lending markets (such as overnight repos or Federal funds market) to make them
  more efficient. If Bank A needs short-term liquidity, it can borrow tokenized
  deposits from Bank B by automatically issuing a tokenized IOU or using a smart
  contract that will return the funds with interest at a set time. Settlement is
  immediate – Bank A receives the liquidity in seconds as tokens – and the terms
  of the loan (interest rate, duration, collateral if any) are enforced by the
  smart contract. This real-time capability reduces counterparty risk (no delay
  where one bank awaits payment) and allows banks to be more agile in managing
  liquidity. Operational risk and cost in interbank lending go down, as the
  entire process from initiation to repayment can be handled on a single
  integrated platform. Additionally, since tokenized deposits are effectively
  digital cash, they serve as high-quality collateral that can be instantly
  transferred or liquidated, making secured lending more attractive.
- **Automated Compliance & Monitoring**: Compliance automation is built into
  tokenized deposit systems. Each token transfer can carry metadata or
  restrictions that enforce KYC/AML policies – for instance, only wallets that
  have been verified by participating banks can hold the tokens, and any large
  transfers can trigger automatic alerts or require additional sign-off. The
  blockchain ledger provides an immutable log of all deposit movements, which
  regulators can be granted access to in real time or near-real time. This
  simplifies reporting obligations: a bank can demonstrate proof of reserves and
  the path of funds easily, since everything is recorded. Auditors can verify
  that tokens in circulation match deposits held. Such transparency enhances
  security by deterring illicit use (it’s harder for bad actors to hide flows on
  a monitored network) and reduces the cost of compliance by cutting down manual
  checks. In fact, tokenization initiatives have shown significant decreases in
  KYC/AML processing costs and reconciliation effort due to these streamlined
  digital workflows.
- **Customer-Centric Payment Ecosystems**: A tokenized deposit could allow
  customers to make instant P2P payments or merchant payments with finality,
  improving everyday banking services. For example, two customers of different
  banks could settle a transaction immediately if both banks use interoperable
  tokenized deposits – the payment would move as a token from one wallet to
  another in seconds. This is far faster than existing interbank retail payment
  methods. Moreover, customers could use their deposit-tokens in new fintech
  apps or smart devices (IoT payments) through APIs, creating an ecosystem of
  services around bank money. Importantly, because these are actual bank
  deposits, they come with the safety of deposit insurance and regulatory
  oversight unlike unregulated crypto. Thus, customers get the usability of
  digital wallets and crypto-like speed, backed by the confidence and stability
  of the traditional banking system. Banks, in turn, gain a competitive edge by
  offering modern digital cash experiences while keeping deposits within a
  secure, compliant framework.
