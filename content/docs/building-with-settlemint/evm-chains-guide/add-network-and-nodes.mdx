  Summary  
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
To build a blockchain application, the first step is setting up a blockchain network with the correct number of validating and non-validating nodes. You can either deploy a permissioned network such as Hyperledger Besu or GoQuorum, or connect to an L1 or L2 Public Network like Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Hedera, Polygon zkEVM, Avalanche, Arbitrum, or Optimism. Both mainnet and testnet versions are available for public networks.

When creating an application on SettleMint, you will be prompted to select a network and assign it a name. By default, a first validating node is deployed along with the network, and you must assign a name to it as well. You may optionally provide an EC DSA P256 private key to use as custom key material for the node identity. If no key is provided, SettleMint will generate one automatically and save it in your private keys.

In SettleMint-managed (SaaS) mode, you will need to choose between a shared or dedicated cluster for deployment. You can also select a cloud provider and a data center of your choice. Additionally, you will have the option to select from small, medium, or large resource packs, which can be scaled up or down later as needed.

Before deploying the network, you will have the option to configure network settings and customize the genesis file. For most use cases, it is recommended to keep the default settings. Once configured, you can proceed with deployment. After a few minutes, your network manager and first node will be fully operational.

To enhance reliability, you should add more nodes to your network for fault tolerance. The best practice is to deploy four validator nodes and two non-validator nodes. Once the nodes are set up, adding a load balancer will help distribute network traffic efficiently and improve performance.

Once your network, nodes, and load balancer are running, you can access the Insights tab to integrate monitoring tools. For permissioned networks, you can add Blockscout Blockchain Explorer to track transactions and network activity. If you are using public EVM networks, publicly available blockchain explorers can be used instead.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up a blockchain network, you need to have an application created
in your workspace. Applications provide the organizational context for all your
blockchain resources including networks, nodes, and development tools. If you haven't created an application yet, follow our
[Create Application](/building-with-settlemint/evm-chains-guide/create-an-organization-and-application) guide
first.

## 1. Add Blockchain Network

For EVM Chains, SettleMint offers Hyperledger Besu and Quorum for permissioned networks and a bunch of public networks to choose from. 
For the list of supported networks please refer - [Supported Networks](/platform-components/blockchain-infrastructure/network-manager#supported-blockchain-network-protocols)

You can perform the same action via the SettleMint SDK CLI as well -

  <p>While deploying a network, you can tune various parameters to optimize performance and execution. The Chain ID serves as a unique identifier for your blockchain network, ensuring proper differentiation from others. The Seconds per block setting controls the block time interval, impacting transaction finality speed. Gas price defines the transaction cost per unit of gas, influencing network fees, while the Gas limit determines the maximum gas allowed per block, affecting computational capacity.</p>

The EVM stack size configures the stack depth for smart contract execution, and the Contract size limit sets the maximum contract code size to manage deployment constraints. Adjusting these settings allows for greater scalability, efficiency, and cost control based on your specific use case.
For EVM Chains, SettleMint allows you to set key genesis file paramters for a custom network configuration.


## Manage a Network

Network management can be done via SettleMint SDK CLI using these commands - 

<Tabs items={['SDK CLI','Platform UI','SDK JS']}>
 <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List networks
    settlemint platform list blockchain-networks --application <app-name>

    # Get network details
    settlemint platform read blockchain-network <network-name>

    # Delete network
    settlemint platform delete blockchain-network <network-name>

    # Restart network
    settlemint platform restart blockchain-network <network-name>
    ```

  </Tab>

    <Tab value="Platform UI">

    Navigate to your network and click **Manage network** to see available actions:
    - View network details and status
    - Monitor network health
    - Restart network operations

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List networks
    await client.blockchainNetwork.list("your-app");

    // Get network details
    await client.blockchainNetwork.read("network-unique-name");

    // Delete network
    await client.blockchainNetwork.delete("network-unique-name");

    // Restart network
    await client.blockchainNetwork.restart("network-unique-name");
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


When we deploy a network, first node is automatically deployed with it and is a validator node. Once you have deployed a permissioned network or joined a public network, you
can add more nodes to it. 


## 2. Add Blockchain Nodes

To see and add nodes, please click on **Blockchain Nodes** tile on the dashboard or use the **Blockchain Nodes** link in the left menu.

 ![Add Node](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-node-via-ui.png)

We recommend the following number of nodes for each envrionment:

| Blockchain Network   | Node Type           | Minimum Nodes for Fault Tolerance |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Hyperledger Besu** | Validator Nodes     | 4 (Byzantine Fault Tolerant BFT)  |
| **Hyperledger Besu** | Non-Validator Nodes | 2 (for redundancy)                |
| **GoQuorum**         | Validator Nodes     | 4 (Istanbul BFT)                  |
| **GoQuorum**         | Non-Validator Nodes | 2 (for redundancy)                |



Nodes can also be added using SettleMint SDK CLI using the following commands-

<Tabs items={['SDK CLI', 'Platform UI','SDK JS']}>

        <li>Click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">

    ```typescript
    // List nodes
    await client.blockchainNode.list("your-application");

    // Get node details
    await client.blockchainNode.read("node-unique-name");

    // Restart node
    await client.blockchainNode.restart("node-unique-name");
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  All operations require appropriate permissions in your workspace.
</Callout>

## 3. Add Load Balancer

To add a load balancer, navigate to the **Blockchain Nodes** section in the SettleMint platform and select your deployed network. Click “Add Load Balancer”, choose the region, provider, and desired resource configuration. Once deployed, the load balancer helps distribute traffic efficiently, improving network reliability and performance.

When selecting nodes to connect to the load balancer, ensure you include at least two non-validator nodes for optimal redundancy. The load balancer can be configured to route requests to specific nodes based on workload distribution, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in your blockchain network.

![Add Load Balancer](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/evm-load-balancer.png)

## 4. Add Blockchain Explorer

To add blockscout blockchain explorer for EVM based permissioned networks, navigate to **Insights** via the left menu or the dashboard tile.
For public networks, you may use publicly available blockchain explorers for the respective network. 

![Add Insights](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-insights.png)
![Insight Details](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/insight-details.png)

### For public networks, please use the following blockchain explorers- 

| **Network**          | **Mainnet Explorer** | **Testnet Explorer** |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Ethereum**        | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) | [Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) / [Holesky](https://holesky.etherscan.io/) |
