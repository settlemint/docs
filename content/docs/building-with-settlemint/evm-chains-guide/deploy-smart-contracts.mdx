  Summary

To begin, you’ll need to write your Solidity smart contract that defines your application’s business logic. This includes designing the data structure using struct, storing the data with mapping, and emitting events to support off-chain indexing. Once written, the contract should be placed in the contracts/ folder inside your Code Studio workspace.

Next, you need to prepare a deployment script using Hardhat Ignition. This
script should go into the ignition/modules/ folder and will declare how your
smart contract should be deployed. You’ll use the buildModule function to
specify which contract to deploy and how it should be initialized.

After setting up the script, you should compile the contract. This step
generates the necessary build artifacts, including the ABI and bytecode, which
are essential for testing, deploying, and integrating the contract with other
components. Depending on the tool used (Hardhat or Foundry), the output will be
stored in the artifacts/ or out/ directory respectively.

Once compiled, it’s important to thoroughly test your contract using either
Foundry or Hardhat. These tests will simulate real-world conditions. Writing
these tests helps you catch logic errors early before deployment.

When the contract passes all tests, you’re ready to deploy. Start your local
network using the Hardhat - Start Network script and run the deployment script
through the IDE task manager. You’ll be prompted to select your custom
deployment script file before the deployment begins.

Finally, to deploy to a SettleMint-hosted blockchain network, authenticate using
the SettleMint Login script, select the appropriate node and private key, and
confirm deployment. The deployed address will be saved in a JSON file under
ignition/deployments/, which can then be used in middleware or frontend
applications to interact with the contract.

## Learning with a **User Data Manager** smart contract example

The goal of this tutorial is to design and build a simple User Data Manager
using Solidity. While the visible use case is centered around managing user data
(such as name, email, age, etc.), the hidden objective is to demonstrate the
core thought process behind building a smart contract that can store, update,
read, and soft delete data on the blockchain.

This example is intentionally kept simple and non-technical in terms of
blockchain identity (no wallets or signatures involved) to help beginners focus
on the fundamentals of: - Designing smart contract data structures (structs and
mappings) - Writing public and restricted functions to interact with data -
Emitting and responding to events - Handling update and soft delete logic to
mimic realistic scenarios (Understand that transaction data is never deleted,
just a more recent entry is added about that record in a newer block on
blockchain)

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll not only learn the foundational patterns
that apply to many real-world blockchain applications but also understand how to
develop and deploy smart contracts on SettleMint platform.

## 1. Let's start with the solidity smart contract code

A smart contract is a self-executing program deployed on the blockchain that
defines rules and logic for how data or assets are managed without relying on
intermediaries. In this tutorial, we are writing our smart contract using
Solidity, the most widely adopted programming language for Ethereum and
EVM-compatible blockchains. Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented
language designed specifically for writing smart contracts that run on the
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

If you’re new to Solidity or want to deepen your understanding, here are some
helpful resources: - Official Solidity Documentation:
https://soliditylang.org/ - Solidity by Example (interactive guide):
https://solidity-by-example.org - CryptoZombies (gamified Solidity learning):
https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity

These resources provide both foundational knowledge and hands-on coding
exercises to help you become comfortable with writing and deploying smart
contracts.

In your learning phase, you can also use ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/ or any of
your go to AI tools for generation of basic solidity smart contracts.

## Smart Contract — Events & Functions Overview

In a smart contract, we define a clear set of events and functions to manage the
lifecycle of user profiles. These building blocks enable seamless interaction
with the contract—supporting profile creation, updates, retrieval, and soft
deletion—while ensuring all changes are traceable through emitted events.

Events play a crucial role in allowing off-chain services like The Graph to
listen for and respond to changes in contract state, whereas functions provide
the core interface for interacting with profile data on-chain.

Below is a structured overview of the key events and functions included in the
contract:

| #   | Events           | Parameters                                                                                           | Description                            |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 3.1 | `ProfileCreated` | `uint256 userId`, `string name`, `string email`, `uint8 age`, `string country`, `bool isKYCApproved` | Emitted when a new profile is created  |
| 3.2 | `ProfileUpdated` | `uint256 userId`, `string name`, `string email`, `uint8 age`, `string country`, `bool isKYCApproved` | Emitted when a profile is updated      |
| 3.3 | `ProfileDeleted` | `uint256 userId`                                                                                     | Emitted when a profile is soft-deleted |

| #   | Functions       | Parameters                                                                                           | Returns              | Description                               |
| --- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 4.1 | `createProfile` | `uint256 userId`, `string name`, `string email`, `uint8 age`, `string country`, `bool isKYCApproved` | –                    | Creates a new user profile                |
| 4.2 | `updateProfile` | `uint256 userId`, `string name`, `string email`, `uint8 age`, `string country`, `bool isKYCApproved` | –                    | Updates an existing profile               |
| 4.3 | `getProfile`    | `uint256 userId`                                                                                     | `UserProfile memory` | Retrieves the profile if not soft-deleted |
| 4.4 | `deleteProfile` | `uint256 userId`                                                                                     | –                    | Soft-deletes the profile                  |

## CRUD Mapping for the Smart Contract

This table maps traditional Web2-style CRUD operations to the equivalent
Solidity functions in the smart contract:

| **CRUD**   | **Solidity Function** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create** | `createProfile()`     | Adds a new user profile to the blockchain using a unique `userId`. This simulates an `INSERT` operation in databases. It checks that the profile does not already exist (unless soft-deleted) and stores the user's details. Emits `ProfileCreated` with full data for off-chain indexing.                     |
| **Read**   | `getProfile()`        | Retrieves an existing profile by its `userId` — similar to a `SELECT` query in SQL. It returns the user's profile only if it hasn’t been soft-deleted. This function is marked `view`, meaning it does not modify blockchain state and can be called without gas.                                              |
| **Update** | `updateProfile()`     | Modifies all fields of an existing user profile. Acts like an `UPDATE` in Web2 databases. It ensures the profile exists and is not deleted, then updates it with the provided values. Emits `ProfileUpdated` with full details for off-chain use.                                                              |
| **Delete** | `deleteProfile()`     | Performs a **soft delete** by setting the `isDeleted` flag to `true`, without removing the actual data from storage. This is similar to a logical delete used in many enterprise databases. The data remains on-chain (for auditability), but `getProfile()` will no longer return it. Emits `ProfileDeleted`. |

## 2. Let's add this smart contract to code studio

When you deploy an **Empty** smart contract set on SettleMint platfrom, you get
a very simple **Counter.sol** contract as an example, you may delete it.

In the contracts folder create a file called **UserData.sol** and copy paste the
content of the above smart contract code.

## 3. Prepare deployment script

In **Ignition** folder, you will find a folder called **Modules**, there you
will find a **main.ts** file which is basically a contract deployment script.
You may delete it if you already know or once you understand the structure. In
this folder create a file called **deployUser.ts**

### Understanding the deployment script code structure.

```ts
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

const UserDataModule = buildModule("UserDataModule", (m) => {
  const userdata = m.contract("UserData");
  return { userdata };
});

export default UserDataModule;
```

**Let's understand key parts of this code-**

This deployment script uses Hardhat Ignition to define and execute the
deployment of a smart contract. It begins by importing the buildModule function
from the Ignition library, which is used to define a deployment module. The
module is named "UserDataModule" and is constructed using a callback function
that receives a context object m.

Within this function, m.contract("UserData") declares that a contract named
UserData (which must match the name inside the Solidity source file) should be
deployed. This is how it knows which contract is being refered.

The deployed contract instance is stored in a variable called userdata. This
instance is then returned from the module so it can be accessed later if needed.
Finally, the module is exported as the default export so it can be run by
Hardhat’s Ignition system using the CLI.

## 4. Compile the smart contract code

When a Solidity smart contract is compiled, the source code is transformed into
low-level bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
This process also generates important metadata such as the ABI (Application
Binary Interface), which defines how external applications or scripts can
interact with the contract’s functions and events. Additionally, the compiler
produces debugging information, source maps, and compiler settings. These
outputs are essential for deploying, testing, and integrating the contract with
dApps or frontend applications.

If you compile using Foundry Build then in **out** folder a folder will be
created with the name of your smart contract file name, and within that folder,
contractname.json and contractname.metadata.json will be generated. This
contractname will be what you have as the name of the contract within solidity
file.
![Foundry Compile Smart Contract](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/foundry-build.png)

If you compile using Hardhat Build, then in **artifacts** folder a folder will
be created with the name of your smart contract file name, and within that
folder - artifacts.d.ts, ContractName.d.ts, ContractName.dbg.ts,
ContractName.json are generated. ContractName.json is the ABI.
![Hardhat Compile Smart Contract](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-build.png)

When you compile a Solidity smart contract in SettleMint , it processes .sol
files and generates various output artifacts needed for deployment and
interaction. For example, after compiling UserData.sol, you get the following
inside the artifacts/ directory:

📂 artifacts/contracts/UserData.sol/

- UserData.json – This is the main artifact file. It contains the ABI
  (Application Binary Interface) - The compiler metadata
- UserData.dbg.json – Debugging info including source maps and AST
- UserData.d.ts – TypeScript definition file for better type safety when using
  the contract in frontend or scripting environments
- artifacts.d.ts – Global TypeScript declarations for all compiled contracts

📂 artifacts/build-info/

- hash.json – Contains detailed compiler input/output and full metadata for the
  build process, useful for verifying or analyzing compilation details

## 5. Test the smart contract

Smart contract testing is a critical part of the development lifecycle in
blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) projects. Since smart contracts
are immutable once deployed to the blockchain, bugs or vulnerabilities can
result in permanent loss of funds, data corruption, or security breaches.
Thorough testing ensures that smart contracts behave as expected under various
scenarios and edge cases before they go live on the mainnet.

Testing frameworks like Hardhat and Foundry provide robust tooling to write and
execute tests in Solidity or JavaScript/TypeScript. These frameworks offer
helpful utilities such as assertions, mock accounts, blockchain state
manipulation (e.g., time travel or snapshot/rollback), and expected reverts.
Additionally, testing libraries like forge-std/Test.sol (in Foundry) or chai (in
Hardhat) enable expressive and readable test assertions.

### Foundry test

In the **test** folder in IDE, create a **UserData.t.sol** file for Foundry test
script.

It uses forge-std/Test.sol is a powerful utility library provided by Foundry’s
standard library (forge-std) that simplifies writing and executing tests for
smart contracts. It extends the base Solidity Test contract and includes a rich
set of assertions, cheatcodes, and debugging tools that make testing more
expressive and efficient.

When a test contract inherits from Test, it gains access to functions like
assertEq, assertTrue, fail, and testing cheatcodes such as vm.prank,
vm.expectRevert, vm.roll, and many more. These tools simulate complex behaviors
and edge cases in a local testing environment without the need to manually
manipulate the EVM state. For example, vm.expectRevert allows developers to
anticipate and verify error conditions, while assertEq simplifies comparisons
between expected and actual results.

        // Expect revert on reading a deleted profile
        vm.expectRevert("Profile not found or has been deleted");
        user.getProfile(3);
    }

    function testCannotCreateDuplicateProfile() public {

This test script leverages Hardhat’s modern support for viem, a lightweight and
fast alternative to Ethers.js, designed for more efficient interaction with
Ethereum contracts. The test uses loadFixture from
hardhat-toolbox-viem/network-helpers to ensure test isolation and efficient
deployments—each test gets a clean contract instance to work with.

Inside the script, we define a fixture function (deployUserFixture) to deploy
the User contract and provide access to the publicClient. The tests cover all
core functionalities of the contract: creating, updating, reading, and
soft-deleting user profiles. Assertions are written using Chai’s expect syntax,
while contract interactions (like write.createProfile and read.getProfile)
follow the Viem pattern, making the test code both concise and expressive.

Please run **Hardhat Test** script to test the smart contract

![Hardhat Test Pass](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-test.png)

Once the test is pass, you can deploy to local hardhat network by using script -
**Hardhat - Deploy to Local Network**

Start test network using **Hardhat - Start Network** script in task manager.

![Start Hardhat Local Network](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-start-test-network.png)

Deploy to test network
![Hardhat Deploy Local](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-deploy-on-test-network.png)

If you click on **Hardhat Deploy to Local Network** and nothing happens, then
you are missing the step to select the correct deployment script and hitting
enter key. You will see a message - **Extra commandline arguments, e.g. --verify
(Press 'Enter' to confirm or 'Escape' to cancel)** in the top middle of the IDE,
hit enter, you will see **ignition/modules/main.ts**, edit the last part at put
the correct filename (e.g. deployUserData.ts), basically the name of the
deployment script you created in ignition folder, and hit enter agian to run the
deployment script. This remains true for all the deploy cases, whether on local
network or platform network.

## 6. Deploy the smart contract to platform network

Hardhat deploy to platform network enter the path of the deployment script

Select the node to which you wish to deploy this smart contract. If you get an
error, please ensure that a private key was created and attached to the node on
which you wish to deploy the smart contract.

Select the private key you wish to use to deploy smart contract. If you are
using a public network or a network with gas fee, then make sure that this
private key's wallet is funded.

Select yes when prompted - **Confirm deploy to network (network name)? ›
(y/N)**.

Wait for a few minutes for the contract to be deployed.

Deployed contract address is stored in deployed_addresses.json file located in
igntition>deployments folder.

Congratulations.!!

You have successfully compiled, tested and deployed your smart contract on
blockchain network.

Now you can proceed to middlewares for getting APIs to do smart contract
transactions, write data to chain and read data in a structured format.
