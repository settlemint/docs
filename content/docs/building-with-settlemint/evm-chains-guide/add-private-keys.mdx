  Summary  
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
To send transactions on a blockchain, you need a private key (with enough funds for gas for networks with a fee). You can create and manage private keys directly within SettleMint using ECDSA, HD ECDSA, or HSM key types.

After creating a key, it must be attached to at least one node to enable
transaction signing—this is critical for smart contract deployment. Without it,
the deployment will fail.

SettleMint also offers User Wallets, a scalable solution that generates wallets
from a single HD ECDSA 256 key. Each user gets a unique address for privacy and
parallel transaction support. You can create user wallets once your HD key is
deployed and running, and fund them as needed for gas-based transactions.

## How to add private keys and user wallets in SettleMint platform

# Private Keys

To send transactions to a blockchain network, you need a private key to sign
these transactions, and the private key should contain enough funds to cover the
gas price for the transaction.

You can sign transactions with private keys you created outside SettleMint with
e.g. MetaMask or other wallet solutions. SettleMint however provides an option
to **create and manage private keys within the platform**.

When you deploy a blockchain node it contains a signing proxy that captures the
eth_sendTransaction call, uses the appropriate key from the private key section
to sign it, and sends it onwards to the blockchain node. You can use this proxy
directly via the nodes JSON-RPC endpoints
([JSON RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)) and via
tools like Hardhat
([HardHat RPC](https://hardhat.org/config/#json-rpc-based-networks)) configured
to use the "remote" default option for signing.

## Create a private key

To add a private key in the SettleMint platform, navigate to the Private keys
section and click Create a private key. You’ll be prompted to select the type of
private key—ECDSA P256, HD ECDSA P256, or HSM ECDSA P256.

  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to your **application**, click **Private keys** in the left navigation, and then click **Create a private key**. This opens a form.

    Follow these steps to create the private key:

    1. Choose a **private key type**:
       - **Accessible ECDSA P256**: Standard Ethereum-style private keys with exposed mnemonic
       - **HD ECDSA P256**: Hierarchical Deterministic keys for advanced key management
       - **HSM ECDSA P256**: Hardware Security Module protected keys for maximum security

    2. Choose a **name** for your private key
    3. Select the **nodes** on which you want the key to be active
    4. Click **Confirm** to create the key

        name: "my-key",
        applicationUniqueName: "my-app",
        privateKeyType: "ACCESSIBLE_ECDSA_P256", // or "HD_ECDSA_P256" or "HSM_ECDSA_P256"
        blockchainNodeUniqueNames: ["node-123"] // optional
      });
      console.log('Private key created:', result);

## Attaching private keys to blockchain nodes (transaction signer)

![Attach Private Key to Node](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/add-key-to-node.png)

Every smart contract deployment involves a transaction that must be signed by an
authorized account. This signature proves that the transaction came from a valid
identity and permits it to be processed by the network. When using SettleMint,
deploying a smart contract via the platform UI or SDK initiates an
eth_sendTransaction call, which must be signed by a private key. However, nodes
cannot inherently sign transactions unless a key has been explicitly activated
and attached to them.

If no private key is attached to the node involved in the deployment, the
process will halt at the signing step. The platform will not be able to
authorize the deployment transaction, resulting in a failed operation. This
makes key-to-node assignment a required step in any production or test setup
involving deployment, contract interactions, or any state-changing blockchain
transaction.

**How to attach a private key to a node** 
1. Go to the Private keys section of
your SettleMint workspace. 
2. Click on the private key (e.g., “Deployer”) you
wish to use for signing transactions. 
3. Navigate to the Nodes tab of that
private key’s page. 
4. You’ll see a list of available nodes in your network
(Validator and RPC nodes). 
5. Select the nodes that should use this key for
transaction signing. These will usually be RPC nodes or validators depending on
your setup. 
6. Once selected, the key becomes active on these nodes and is used
for signing all outgoing transactions initiated from the platform.

**Best practices and nuances** 
1. Always attach the key to at least one node
before deploying a smart contract. In most cases, attaching it to an RPC node is sufficient. 
2. Avoid attaching the same key to multiple nodes unless required, to reduce the risk of key misuse or unnecessary transaction replay. 
3. Ensure the private key has sufficient funds (ETH or native token) to pay for gas costs associated with contract deployment if working on public chains or non-zero gas fee networks. 
4. For security reasons, only assign signing permissions to nodes you trust and control. 
5. Consider using an HD key if you want to manage multiple identities derived from the same mnemonic, but ensure the correct derivation path is used.

## Manage private keys

<Tabs items={['SDK CLI', 'Platform UI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    1. Navigate to your application's **Private keys** section
    2. Click on a private key to:
       - View details and status
       - Manage node associations
       - Check balances
       - Fund the key
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List all private keys
    settlemint platform list private-keys --application <app-name>

    # View specific key details
    settlemint platform read private-key <private-key-unique-name>

    # Restart a private key
    settlemint platform restart private-key <private-key-unique-name>
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List private keys
    const listKeys = async () => {
      const keys = await client.privateKey.list("your-app-name");
    };

    // Get key details
    const getKey = async () => {
      const key = await client.privateKey.read("key-unique-name");
    };

    // Restart key
    const restartKey = async () => {
      await client.privateKey.restart("key-unique-name");
    };
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Fund the private key

For networks that require gas to perform a transaction, your private key should
contain enough funds to cover the gas price.

1. Click the **private key** in the overview to see detailed information
2. Open the **Balances tab**
3. Click **Fund**
4. Scan the **QR code** with your wallet/exchange to fund the key

<Callout type="info">
  Ensure your private key has sufficient funds before attempting transactions on
  networks that require gas fees.
</Callout>

## User Wallets

SettleMint's **User Wallets** feature offers a production-ready solution for
managing infinite wallets with efficiency and scalability. This tool empowers
users with seamless wallet generation, ensuring **cost-effective management**
and eliminating additional expenses. By generating **unique addresses for each
user**, privacy is significantly enhanced, while improved performance ensures
faster, parallel transaction processing through separate nonces. User wallet
also simplifies wallet recovery since all wallets are derived from a single
master key. User wallets use the same signing proxy to sign transactions with
the corresponding user private key.

## Create and Setup User Wallets

To set up your user wallets, navigate to your application, click **Private
keys** in the left navigation, and then click **Create a private key**. This
opens a form.

Select **HD ECDSA P256** as the private key type then, enter a **name** for your
deployment. You can also select the nodes or load balancers on which you want to
enable the user wallets. You can change this later if you want to use your user
wallets on a different node. Click **Confirm** to deploy the wallet.

When your deployment status is **Running**, you can click on it to check the
details. You can see the Mnemonic from which the user wallets are generated
under **Key material**. Upon initialization, the User Wallets section is empty.
To create your first user wallet, click on **Create a user wallet**.

Remember that for networks that require gas to perform a transaction, the user
wallet should contain enough funds to cover the gas price. You can fund it using
the address displayed in the list.
