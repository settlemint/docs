  "Command-line interface for managing SettleMint blockchain applications"
---

## Overview

The SettleMint CLI is a powerful command-line tool that provides developers with
direct access to the SettleMint platform's capabilities. It streamlines the
process of creating, managing, and deploying blockchain applications without
requiring expertise in underlying infrastructure. The SettleMint CLI can be
utilized in various ways depending on your workflow preferences and project
requirements. You can install it as a dependency in your project, globally on
your system, or use it through GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

## As a dependency in your package.json

Installing the SettleMint CLI as a project dependency ensures that everyone
working on your project uses the same version of the CLI, maintaining
consistency across development environments.

```bash
# npm
npm install @settlemint/sdk-cli
npx settlemint --version

# bun
bun add @settlemint/sdk-cli
bunx settlemint --version

# pnpm
pnpm add @settlemint/sdk-cli
pnpm dlx settlemint --version

# yarn
yarn add @settlemint/sdk-cli
yarn create settlemint --version
```

## Globally install the CLI

Installing the CLI globally provides convenient access from any directory on
your system, making it ideal for developers who work on multiple SettleMint
projects or need to quickly access CLI commands without project-specific
configuration.

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @settlemint/sdk-cli

# bun
bun install -g @settlemint/sdk-cli

# pnpm
pnpm add -g @settlemint/sdk-cli

# yarn
yarn global add @settlemint/sdk-cli
```

You can access the CLI globally by running settlemint in your terminal.

## GitHub Action

The SettleMint GitHub Action enables seamless integration of platform operations
within your CI/CD workflows. This allows you to automate blockchain deployments,
testing, and infrastructure management as part of your development pipeline.

Basic example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Get SettleMint CLI version
    uses: settlemint/settlemint-action@main
    with:
      access-token: ${{ secrets.SETTLEMINT_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      command: "--version"
```

For detailed setup instructions, refer to SettleMint GitHub Action Docs

## Examples

Here are some basic examples to help you get started with the SettleMint CLI.
These commands demonstrate how to check the CLI version and access help
documentation for different commands.

```bash
# Get the version of the CLI
settlemint --version

# View help for any command
settlemint --help
settlemint platform --help
settlemint platform create --help
```

## Authentication

Authentication is required before using the SettleMint CLI to interact with your
platform environment. This ensures secure access to your resources and prevents
unauthorized operations.

Before using any CLI commands that interact with your SettleMint environment,
you must authenticate using a Personal Access Token (PAT). You can create a PAT
from your user profile in the SettleMint console.

## Login

The login command authenticates your CLI session with the SettleMint platform,
establishing a secure connection that allows you to execute commands on your
account's resources.

```bash
settlemint login
```

To login using a token passed through STDIN:

```bash
cat ~/my_token.txt | settlemint login --token-stdin --accept-defaults
```

Options

```bash
-a, --accept-defaults      Accept the default and previously set values
--token-stdin              Provide a token using STDIN
-i, --instance <instance>  The instance to login to (defaults to the instance in the .env file)
-h, --help                 display help for command
```

## Logout

The logout command terminates your authenticated session with the SettleMint
platform, ensuring your credentials are securely removed from the local
environment.

```bash
settlemint logout
```

Options

```bash
--all       Logout from all instances
-h, --help  display help for command
```

## Project connection

The connect command links your local development environment to a specific
SettleMint application, allowing the CLI to execute commands in the context of
that application. This simplifies workflows by automatically targeting the right
application for your operations.

```bash
# Connect
settlemint connect
```

Options

```bash
--prod                     Connect to your production environment
-a, --accept-defaults      Accept the default and previously set values
-i, --instance <instance>  The instance to connect to (defaults to the instance in the .env file)
-h, --help                 display help for command
```

## Blockchain utilities

The CLI provides specialized utilities for blockchain operations that help
developers interact with blockchain nodes and perform common tasks related to
blockchain development.

The CLI also provides features for blockchain node management, including pincode
verification response retrieval.

```bash
# Pincode verification response
settlemint pincode-verification-response

# You can also use the alias pvr.
```

Options

```bash
--wallet-address <walletAddress>    The wallet address to get pincode verification response for
-i, --instance <instance>           The instance to connect to (defaults to the .env file)
--blockchain-node <blockchainNode>  Blockchain Node unique name to get pincode verification response for
-h, --help                          display help for command
```

### Create Private Key

The Create Private Key command generates and securely stores cryptographic keys
that can be used for blockchain transactions, smart contract deployment, and
other operations requiring digital signatures. The SettleMint platform offers
multiple key storage options with varying security levels.

```bash
Usage: settlemint platform create private-key|pk [options] [command] Create a
private key in the SettleMint platform

help [command] display help for command
```

#### HD ECDSA P256 Private Key

The HD ECDSA P256 Private Key option creates a hierarchical deterministic key
using the ECDSA P256 algorithm. HD keys allow for the generation of multiple
derived keys from a single master key, providing flexibility for key management
while maintaining security.

```bash
Usage: settlemint platform create private-key hd-ecdsa-p256|hd

Examples:
# Create a private key and save as default
$ settlemint platform create private-key hd-ecdsa-p256 my-key --accept-defaults -d

# Create a private key in a different application
$ settlemint platform create private-key hd-ecdsa-p256 my-key --application my-app

# Create a private key linked to a blockchain node
$ settlemint platform create private-key hd-ecdsa-p256 my-key --blockchain-node node-123

```

#### HSM ECDSA P256 Private Key

The HSM ECDSA P256 Private Key option creates a key stored in a Hardware
Security Module (HSM). HSMs provide the highest level of security by performing
cryptographic operations within a tamper-resistant hardware device, preventing
the key from ever being exposed in memory.

```bash
Usage: settlemint platform create private-key hsm-ecdsa-p256|hsm

Examples:
# Create a private key and save as default
$ settlemint platform create private-key hsm-ecdsa-p256 my-key --accept-defaults -d

# Create a private key in a different application
$ settlemint platform create private-key hsm-ecdsa-p256 my-key --application 123456789

# Create a private key linked to a blockchain node
$ settlemint platform create private-key hsm-ecdsa-p256 my-key --blockchain-node node-123

Arguments:
name The HSM-ECDSA-P256 private key name

Options:
-a, --accept-defaults Accept the default values
-d, --default Save as default private key
--prod Connect to production environment
-w, --wait Wait until deployed
-r, --restart-if-timeout Restart if wait time is exceeded
--application <application> Application unique name

-h, --help display help for command
```

#### Accessible ECDSA P256 Private Key

The Accessible ECDSA P256 Private Key option creates a key that can be exported
and accessed directly by applications. This provides more flexibility for
integrations but with lower security compared to HSM keys, as the private key
material can be exposed to the application.

```bash
Usage: settlemint platform create private-key accessible-ecdsa-p256|acc

Examples:
# Create a private key and save as default
$ settlemint platform create private-key accessible-ecdsa-p256 my-key --accept-defaults -d

# Create a private key in a different application
$ settlemint platform create private-key accessible-ecdsa-p256 my-key --application my-app

# Create a private key linked to a blockchain node
$ settlemint platform create private-key accessible-ecdsa-p256 my-key --blockchain-node node-123

Arguments:
name The ACCESSIBLE-ECDSA-P256 private key name

Options:
-a, --accept-defaults Accept the default values
-d, --default Save as default private key
--prod Connect to production environment
-w, --wait Wait until deployed
-r, --restart-if-timeout Restart if wait time is exceeded
