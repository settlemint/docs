# 🧾 Subgraph Project Structure – Deep Dive for `MyContract.sol`

This document provides a complete, line-by-line breakdown of a subgraph project
folder designed to index events from an Ethereum smart contract named
`MyContract.sol`. It follows the conventions used by
[The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) and tooling like
[SettleMint Subgraph Generator](https://settlemint.com).

## 🔧 `subgraph.config.json`

### ✅ Purpose:

This file is consumed by SettleMint's CLI or The Graph CLI (`graph codegen`,
`graph build`) to bootstrap subgraph code and configuration.

### 🔍 Breakdown:

```json
{
  "output": "generated/scs.",
  "chain": "localhost",
  "datasources": [
    {
      "name": "MyContract",
      "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "startBlock": 0,
      "module": ["mycontract"]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output`      | Directory for generated TypeScript types (`generated/` folder). Often linked to `schema.graphql`, `ABI`, and handler typing. |
| `chain`       | Blockchain environment to index (e.g., `mainnet`, `localhost`, `polygon`, `arbitrum-one`).                                   |
| `datasources` | Array of contract modules to be indexed. Each maps to a folder and .yaml config inside `datasources/`.                       |
| `name`        | Logical name of this contract or module (used in code and schema).                                                           |
| `address`     | On-chain deployed address of `MyContract.sol`. Must be accurate for indexing to work.                                        |
| `startBlock`  | First block number to index from (skip historical blocks for faster sync).                                                   |
| `module`      | Name of folder containing `*.yaml`, `*.ts`, and `*.gql.json` files for this contract.                                        |

> 💡 **Tip:** Use the block number where your contract was deployed to avoid
> unnecessary indexing of irrelevant historical data.

## 📄 `datasources/mycontract.gql.json`

### ✅ Purpose:

This is a **JSON-encoded GraphQL schema**, which defines the shape of your
indexed data. Each `type` here corresponds to an **entity** stored in the
subgraph’s database.

### 🧾 Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "MyEntity",
    "description": "Stores state emitted from MyContract events",
    "fields": [
      { "name": "id", "type": "ID!" },
      { "name": "creator", "type": "Bytes!" },
      { "name": "status", "type": "String!" },
      { "name": "timestamp", "type": "BigInt!" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 🔍 Field Types:

- `ID!`: Required unique identifier (`string` format, often tx hash or entity
  composite key).
- `Bytes`: EVM-style address or 32-byte values.
- `BigInt`: For uint256, block numbers, timestamps.
- `String`, `Boolean`, `Int`: Basic GraphQL types.
- `@derivedFrom`: Used for reverse relationships (foreign keys) but only in
  `.graphql`, not `.gql.json`.

> 💡 Use `id` as a combination of `transactionHash-logIndex` for uniqueness in
> event-based entities.

---

## 📄 `datasources/mycontract.yaml`

### ✅ Purpose:

This is the **manifest file** that connects your smart contract to its:

- Deployed address
- ABI definition
- Events you want to index
- GraphQL schema
- Event handler functions

### 🧾 Example:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.2
schema:
  file: mycontract.gql.json

dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: MyContract
    network: localhost
    source:
      address: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
      abi: MyContract
      startBlock: 0
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      apiVersion: 0.0.5
      entities:
        - MyEntity
      abis:
        - name: MyContract
          file: "../../abis/MyContract.json"
      eventHandlers:
        - event: MyEvent(indexed uint256,string)
          handler: handleMyEvent
      file: mycontract.ts
```

### 🔍 Key Fields:

| Section            | Field      | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dataSources`      | `name`     | Logical label for contract.                                        |
| `source.address`   |            | Deployed contract address.                                         |
| `source.abi`       |            | Refers to `name` under `abis:`.                                    |
| `startBlock`       |            | Block number from which to start processing.                       |
| `mapping.entities` |            | List of entities affected by this contract.                        |
| `abis.file`        |            | Path to `.json` ABI file of contract (must match source).          |
| `eventHandlers`    | `event:`   | Signature of the Solidity event being indexed.                     |
|                    | `handler:` | Name of exported function from `.ts` file that handles this event. |

> ⚠️ `event:` must **exactly match** the ABI event signature, including indexed
> fields.

---

## 📄 `datasources/mycontract.ts`

### ✅ Purpose:

This file contains **AssemblyScript handler functions** that transform on-chain
events into **GraphQL entities**. These handlers are executed by the subgraph
runtime when matching events appear on-chain.

### 🧾 Example:

```ts
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import { MyEvent as MyEventType } from "../generated/MyContract/MyContract";
import { MyEntity } from "../generated/schema";
import { fetchMyEntity } from "../fetch/mycontractdata";

export function handleMyEvent(event: MyEventType): void {
  let entity = fetchMyEntity(event.params.id);
  entity.creator = event.transaction.from;
  entity.status = event.params.status;
  entity.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.save();
}
```

### 🔍 What's Happening:

- Event is imported from auto-generated `MyContract.ts` (compiled ABI).
- A helper is called to load or create an entity (`fetchMyEntity`).
- Event parameters and context (tx sender, timestamp) are assigned to fields.
- Entity is stored using `.save()`.

> 🧩 Best practice: use `fetch*` functions to reduce duplication and enforce
> default values.

---

## 📄 `fetch/mycontractdata.ts`

### ✅ Purpose:

Contains utility functions to fetch an entity from the store **or create it if
it doesn't exist**. Useful for enforcing schema defaults and ensuring consistent
object initialization.

### 🧾 Example:

```ts
import { MyEntity } from "../../generated/schema";
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";

export function fetchMyEntity(id: BigInt): MyEntity {
  let key = id.toString();
  let entity = MyEntity.load(key);

  if (!entity) {
    entity = new MyEntity(key);
    entity.creator = Bytes.empty();
    entity.status = "PENDING";
    entity.timestamp = BigInt.zero();
  }

  return entity;
}
```

### 🔍 Why It's Important:

- Prevents null pointer errors in `.ts` handler files.
- Centralizes logic for initializing new entities.
- Keeps handler functions small and readable.

| `mycontract.gql.json`  | GraphQL schema defining the structure of data to be stored. |
| `mycontract.yaml`      | Contract address, ABI, events, and mapping file linkage.    |
| `mycontract.ts`        | Event-to-entity transformation logic in AssemblyScript.     |
| `mycontractdata.ts`    | Reusable logic to load or create GraphQL entities safely.   |

## 🛠️ Best Practices

- 🧪 Always test your subgraph locally with a dev chain before deploying.
- 🧱 Use composite IDs (`txHash-logIndex`) for events to avoid collisions.
- ⚙️ Keep `fetch/` files modular to reduce logic in event handlers.
- 📊 Use `BigInt`, `Bytes`, and `Boolean` types consistently with EVM data.

> 🔁 This setup is modular, clean, and scalable for multi-contract projects,
> cross-chain indexing, or advanced state machine tracking.
