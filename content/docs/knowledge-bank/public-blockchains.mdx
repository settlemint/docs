# Public blockchain networks

<Callout type="info">
  Public blockchains are permissionless networks where anyone can participate in
  the network operations.
</Callout>

    ### Layer 1 Networks
    - **Ethereum**
      - Smart contract platform
      - EVM compatibility
      - Large developer ecosystem
    - **Bitcoin**
      - First blockchain
      - Store of value
      - Limited programmability
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Layer 2 Solutions
    - **Polygon PoS**
      - Ethereum sidechain
      - Fast transactions
      - Low fees
    - **Optimism & Arbitrum**
      - Optimistic rollups
      - EVM compatible
      - Scalability focused
  </Card>

## Key characteristics

### 1. Permissionless access

- Open participation
- Anyone can run a node
- Public transaction visibility

### 2. Decentralization

- Distributed governance
- No central authority
- Community-driven development

### 3. Security model

- Economic incentives
- Cryptographic proofs
- Consensus mechanisms

## Network comparisons

### Ethereum

- Smart contract platform
- Large developer ecosystem
- High security
- Higher transaction costs

### Polygon

- Ethereum scaling solution
- Fast transactions
- Lower costs
- Bridge to Ethereum

### Optimism/arbitrum

- Layer 2 rollups
- Ethereum security
- Reduced fees
- Quick finality

## Use cases

1. **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**

   - Lending/borrowing
   - Trading
   - Yield farming

2. **NFTs**

   - Digital art
   - Gaming assets
   - Collectibles

3. **DAOs**
   - Governance
   - Treasury management
   - Community coordination

## Technical considerations

### Network selection

- Transaction costs
- Speed requirements
- Security needs
- Developer tooling

### Infrastructure

- Node requirements
- RPC endpoints
- Network stability

### Development

- Smart contract languages
- Testing frameworks
- Development tools

<Callout type="warning">
  Public networks require careful consideration of gas fees, transaction speed,
  and security requirements for your specific use case.
