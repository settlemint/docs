# Smart contracts

<Callout type="info">
  Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into
  code.
</Callout>

## Core concepts

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <Card>
    ### Contract Structure
    - State variables
    - Functions
    - Events
    - Modifiers
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Contract Types
    - Standard contracts
    - Library contracts
    - Interface contracts
    - Proxy contracts
  </Card>
</div>

## Development lifecycle

### 1. design

- Requirements analysis
- Architecture planning
- Security considerations
- Gas optimization

### 2. implementation

- Code writing
- Testing
- Documentation
- Optimization

### 3. deployment

- Network selection
- Gas estimation
- Contract verification
- Initial setup

## Security considerations

1. **Common Vulnerabilities**

   - Reentrancy
   - Integer overflow
   - Access control
   - Front-running

2. **Best Practices**
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions
   - Pull over Push
   - Emergency stops
   - Access controls

## Testing & verification

### Unit testing

- Function testing
- State changes
- Event emissions
- Error conditions

### Integration testing

- Contract interactions
- System workflows
- Edge cases
- Gas optimization

<Callout type="warning">
  Always audit smart contracts thoroughly before deployment to production
  networks.
</Callout>
