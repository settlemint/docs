Deposits digitally represent traditional banking deposits, providing financial
institutions with enhanced security, real-time transparency, and rigorous
compliance capabilities. Key features include customizable allowlists, custodial
oversight, robust role-based management, and integrated meta-transactions,
simplifying institutional deposit administration.

<br></br>
Tokenized deposit tokens are digital representations of traditional bank
deposits, issued and managed within regulated banking environments. They offer
the trust and backing of conventional deposits while introducing the speed,
programmability, and transparency of blockchain technology. Tokenized deposits
allow banks to modernize core operations, enhance payment infrastructure, and
create customer-centric services, all while maintaining compliance with
financial regulations. This solution ensures deposits remain securely within the
banking system, while enabling 24/7 digital cash-like functionality.

## Why tokenized deposits?

Tokenized deposits modernize legacy banking processes by allowing real-time
transactions, streamlined interbank transfers, and programmable banking
products. They are issued on permissioned blockchains by regulated banks and
represent a direct claim on a customer’s deposit held on the bank’s balance
sheet. Unlike stablecoins that may be issued by private entities off-chain,
tokenized deposits retain their regulatory clarity, deposit insurance
eligibility, and balance sheet integrity. These digital instruments bring
efficiency, transparency, and interoperability to institutional and retail
banking services alike.

## Institutional use cases

Tokenized deposits enable instant interbank payments without reliance on
traditional settlement systems such as ACH or wire transfers. Using a shared
ledger, banks can transfer tokenized deposits 24/7, with immediate settlement
and finality. For example, Citi has demonstrated how tokenized deposits can
facilitate real-time cross-border liquidity transfers between branches, enabling
large-value payments to settle continuously, regardless of time zones or central
bank hours. This significantly improves liquidity management and reduces delays
in time-sensitive financial operations.

<br></br>

They also allow banks to build programmable and customer-friendly deposit
products. A deposit represented as a token can be programmed with instructions,
such as auto-paying bills, sweeping balances into savings or investment
accounts, or enforcing conditions like escrow releases or overdraft protection.
Smart contracts attached to tokenized deposits allow real-time interest
calculation and distribution without batch processing. This flexibility empowers
customers with greater control over their funds, while banks maintain compliance
and security in the background.

<br></br>

In interbank lending markets, tokenized deposits simplify short-term liquidity
management. Banks can issue, lend, and repay funds using smart contracts that
enforce repayment schedules, interest rates, and collateralization terms.
Settlement occurs instantly, eliminating the delays and risks associated with
legacy systems. Since tokenized deposits are considered digital cash, they serve
as high-quality collateral, improving confidence and accessibility in secured
lending. This improves agility in liquidity operations and reduces both
operational risk and cost.

<br></br>

Compliance and monitoring are automated at the protocol level. Each transfer can
carry embedded rules for KYC/AML checks, and only verified accounts may hold or
transfer tokens. Large transactions can trigger alerts or require additional
sign-offs automatically. The entire transaction history is recorded immutably
on-chain, which regulators and auditors can access in near real time. This
drastically simplifies audit preparation, reduces reconciliation effort, and
ensures full transparency of fund flows. Banks can demonstrate reserve backing,
transaction traceability, and compliance adherence with minimal overhead.

<br></br>

Tokenized deposits also support a broader customer-centric payment ecosystem.
Consumers could make instant peer-to-peer payments or retail purchases by
transferring tokenized deposits between wallets. This transaction occurs in
seconds, without delays seen in traditional interbank retail payment rails.
Banks can offer APIs to fintech apps and connected devices, enabling use cases
like IoT-triggered payments, automated subscriptions, or digital commerce
experiences. Unlike crypto wallets, these digital deposits remain fully
regulated and covered by deposit insurance, preserving the safety of customer
funds. Banks benefit by offering modern digital money services while retaining
customer balances within a compliant framework.

## Token capabilities

Tokenized deposits are issued through a controlled and compliant mechanism.
Role-based permissions ensure that minting, transfers, and redemptions are only
executed by authorized users. The issuance of tokens reflects actual deposits
held, maintaining 1:1 reserve backing and aligning with regulatory obligations.

<br></br>

Access is managed using allowlists and account-level permissions. User
onboarding can be controlled through pre-approved lists, ensuring only
KYC-verified clients may hold or transact tokenized deposits. This built-in
compliance infrastructure aligns with AML regulations and supports real-time
monitoring of account activity. Administrators are also equipped with pause
capabilities to suspend operations during audits, regulatory reviews, or risk
events.

<br></br>

Custodial support is available for enterprise-grade asset management.
Institutions can hold and manage client tokens under secure custodianship with
oversight capabilities. Meta-transaction functionality is also supported,
allowing third-party relayers to pay for gas on behalf of users. This improves
accessibility and user experience, particularly in consumer banking environments
where end users may not manage wallets or gas fees directly.

## Enterprise applications

Tokenized deposits are well suited for a wide range of institutional and retail
applications. Banks can digitize large-value settlements between branches,
automate treasury operations, and offer programmable account services to
corporate clients. Fintechs can build new applications on top of tokenized
deposits through APIs, while regulators gain visibility into the flow of funds
in real time. Use cases span instant payroll, programmable savings, micro-loans,
escrow services, and integrated financial services across web and mobile
channels. The infrastructure can also support central bank digital currency
pilots or be integrated into existing national payment systems.

<br></br>

Tokenized deposits deliver a secure, compliant, and modern alternative to
traditional deposit instruments. They combine the trust and regulatory
safeguards of conventional bank deposits with the flexibility and efficiency of
blockchain. By supporting real-time transfers, programmability, auditability,
and seamless integration into banking systems, tokenized deposits empower
financial institutions to offer next-generation digital cash services with
confidence.
