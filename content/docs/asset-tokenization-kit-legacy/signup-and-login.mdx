## How do I access my asset tokenization platform?

Accessing your tokenization platform requires enterprise-grade security setup to protect digital assets worth millions. This guide walks you through the secure onboarding process that financial institutions and enterprises use to safeguard tokenized securities.

### Who needs secure platform access?

- **Platform Administrators**: Managing the entire tokenization ecosystem
- **Asset Issuers**: Creating and managing tokenized securities
- **Compliance Officers**: Overseeing regulatory requirements
- **Investors**: Accessing and managing digital asset portfolios
- **Auditors**: Reviewing platform operations and transactions

### What security challenges does this solve?

  <Card title="Account Recovery" description="Secure backup methods for lost credentials" />
  <Card title="Regulatory Compliance" description="Meet KYC/AML requirements" />
</Cards>

## Step 1: How do I find my platform URL?

Locate your unique platform endpoint in the SettleMint dashboard:

![Access your tokenization platform endpoint](/images/btp/application-kits/access-endpoint.png)

**Where to find your endpoint**:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to Custom Deployments section
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the "Connect" tab
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy your secure HTTPS endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Bookmark for easy access
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Security tip">
  Your platform URL is unique and secured with SSL/TLS encryption. Never access through unsecured HTTP connections.
</Callout>

## Step 2: How do I create my admin account?

The first user to register automatically receives platform administrator privileges:

![Secure signup process for asset tokenization platform](/images/btp/application-kits/sign-up.png)

### What information is required for signup?

**Account Creation Fields**:
- **Email Address**: Corporate email for notifications
- **Password**: Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements
- **Organization**: Company name for multi-tenant setup
- **Role Selection**: Admin, Issuer, or Investor

**First User Privileges**:
- Full platform administration rights
- User management capabilities
- Asset creation permissions
- System configuration access
- Compliance monitoring tools

### Why does the first user get admin rights?

This design enables rapid platform deployment while maintaining security:
- Immediate platform control without external configuration
- Simplified onboarding for proof-of-concepts
- Clear ownership establishment
- Audit trail starts from account creation

## Step 3: How do I secure my wallet with PIN protection?

After account creation, you must establish transaction security:

### What is the 6-digit PIN used for?

The PIN serves as your transaction authorization key:
- **Asset Transfers**: Confirm before sending tokens
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Authorize blockchain operations
- **Administrative Actions**: Approve critical platform changes
- **Wallet Access**: Additional layer beyond password

### PIN Security Best Practices:

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Best Practices">
  **DO**:
  - Use a unique PIN not used elsewhere
  - Change PIN quarterly
  - Enable biometric unlock on mobile
  - Use different PINs for test/production
  
  **DON'T**:
  - Use birthdays or sequential numbers
  - Share PIN with anyone
  - Write PIN near computer
  - Use same PIN as bank cards
</Callout>

## Step 4: How do I save my recovery codes?

The platform generates one-time recovery codes for emergency access:

### What are recovery codes used for?

**Emergency Scenarios**:
- Lost authentication device
- Forgotten PIN
- Compromised primary credentials
- Employee offboarding
- Disaster recovery

### How should I store recovery codes?

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Password Manager (Recommended)">
    Encrypted digital vault for secure storage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hardware Security Module">
    For enterprise deployments requiring maximum security
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bank Safety Deposit">
    Physical backup for high-value accounts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Split Storage">
    Divide codes between secure locations for redundancy
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Warning">
  Recovery codes are shown only once. After closing the screen, they cannot be retrieved. Loss of recovery codes while locked out means permanent account loss.
</Callout>

## How do passkeys provide passwordless authentication?

The Asset Tokenization Kit implements FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys for bank-grade security without passwords:

### What are passkeys?

Passkeys are cryptographic credentials that replace passwords entirely:
- **Technology**: Public-key cryptography (FIDO2/WebAuthn standard)
- **Storage**: Secure enclave on your device or cloud keychain
- **Security**: Phishing-proof, no shared secrets
- **User Experience**: One-touch biometric authentication

### How do passkeys work for asset tokenization?
