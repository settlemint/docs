<Callout type="success" title="AI-Powered Blockchain Analysis">
**Who benefits:** Teams building or operating blockchain applications — developers, analysts, compliance, and operations — who need rapid, accurate on‑chain insights

**Technical breakthrough:** Query your permissioned SettleMint networks using natural language - no more complex API calls or block explorer clicking

**Business impact:** Faster, more reliable blockchain analysis, streamlined compliance reporting, and AI-assisted transaction pattern detection
</Callout>

## Transform Raw Blockchain Data Into Insights

Traditional block explorers require manual clicking, complex API calls, and technical knowledge. The Block Explorer MCP bridges this gap by enabling **natural language blockchain queries** through any MCP-compatible client (e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini clients with MCP, and others).

## Quick Start Guide

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install the Enhanced MCP Server

The SettleMint-enhanced version includes native support for permissioned networks with proper authentication.

```bash
# 1. Clone the SettleMint-enhanced MCP server
git clone https://github.com/settlemint/blockscout-mcp-server.git
cd blockscout-mcp-server

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# 3. Verify installation
python3 -m blockscout_mcp_server --help
```

<Callout type="info" title="Automated Setup Available">
The MCP server includes a `setup.sh` script that automates the installation, configuration, and testing process. Run `./setup.sh` for guided setup.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure Your SettleMint Network

**Create a `.env` file** with your SettleMint network details:

```bash
# Create from template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your favorite editor
nano .env
```

**Add your SettleMint configuration:**

```bash
# .env file (NEVER commit this to version control)
BLOCKSCOUT_SETTLEMINT_CHAIN_ID=YOUR_CHAIN_ID
BLOCKSCOUT_SETTLEMINT_BLOCKSCOUT_URL=https://your-explorer-url.settlemint.com/
BLOCKSCOUT_SETTLEMINT_APPLICATION_ACCESS_TOKEN=sm_aat_xxxxx
```

**📍 Where to find your values:**
- **Chain ID**: SettleMint Platform → [Network Manager](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/platform-components/blockchain-infrastructure/network-manager) → Your Blockchain → Network Details
- **Blockscout URL**: SettleMint Platform → [Insights](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/platform-components/blockchain-infrastructure/insights) → Block Explorer → Connect (copy URL without token)
- **Access Token**: SettleMint Platform → [Access tokens](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/platform-components/security-and-authentication/application-access-tokens) → Create new token

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure Your AI Platform

<Tabs items={['Cursor IDE', 'Claude Desktop', 'Claude Code (VS Code)']}>
<Tab value="Cursor IDE">

**1. Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "settlemint-blockscout": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "-m", "blockscout_mcp_server",
        "--http"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Important Cursor Configuration">
- The `--http` flag is **required** for Cursor integration
- Update the `"cwd"` path to your mcp-server directory
- **DO NOT** add environment variables here - they're loaded from `.env`
</Callout>

**2. Restart Cursor completely** (Cmd+Q on Mac, then reopen)

**3. Check for green MCP status indicator** in the bottom status bar

</Tab>
<Tab value="Claude Desktop">

**1. Create or edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:**
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "settlemint-blockscout": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "-m", "blockscout_mcp_server"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Update the `"cwd"` path** to your mcp-server directory

**3. Restart Claude Desktop** → Look for 🔌 connection indicator

</Tab>
<Tab value="Claude Code (VS Code)">

**1. Open VS Code → Settings → search "Claude MCP" → "Edit in settings.json"**

**2. Add to `settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "claude.mcpServers": {
    "settlemint-blockscout": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "blockscout_mcp_server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Update the `"cwd"` path** to your mcp-server directory

**4. Reload Window** → Claude Code will auto-connect to the MCP server

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Test Your Setup

**1. Run the connection test script:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/mcp-server
python3 test_connection.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ Configuration Check
✅ Resolved URL
✅ Latest block: #[block_number]
✅ Connection Test Successful!
```

**2. Ask your AI assistant:**
```
"What's the latest block on chain 40319?"
```
(Replace 40319 with your actual chain ID)

You should see the MCP server automatically connect and return current blockchain data!

## Architecture Overview

The Block Explorer MCP creates a seamless bridge between AI assistants and your SettleMint blockchain infrastructure:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Assistant<br/>Cursor/Claude] --> B[Block Explorer<br/>MCP Server]
    B --> C[SettleMint<br/>Blockscout API]
    C --> D[Permissioned Besu<br/>Network]
    
    B --> E[Public Chain<br/>APIs]
    E --> F[Ethereum<br/>Polygon, etc.]
```

**Key Components:**

1. **AI Assistant Layer**: Natural language interface (Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop)
2. **MCP Protocol Bridge**: Translates AI requests into blockchain API calls
3. **SettleMint Authentication**: Token-based auth via query parameters (`?token=`)
4. **Security**: Credentials stored in `.env` file, never in configuration files
5. **Multi-Chain Support**: Works with both permissioned SettleMint and public networks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="MCP Server Not Starting">

**Symptoms:** AI assistant shows no blockchain tools available

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Python installation:** `python3 --version` (requires 3.11+)
2. **Verify MCP server install:** `python3 -m blockscout_mcp_server --help`
3. **For Cursor:** Ensure you included the `--http` flag in args
4. **Test configuration:** Validate JSON syntax in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
5. **Completely quit and restart** your AI platform (not just reload)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissioned Network Connection Failed">

**Symptoms:** "Chain not found" or authentication errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Chain ID:** Must match exactly (e.g., 40319)
2. **Check Access Token:** Ensure it's valid and not expired
   - Use Application tokens (`sm_aat_`) for production
   - Platform tokens (`sm_pat_`) work but have broader scope
3. **Confirm Blockscout URL:** Should NOT include the token in the URL
4. **Clear cache:** Restart the MCP server if you see cached "not found" errors
5. **Authentication method:** The server uses `?token=` query parameters, not headers

**Debug command:**
```bash
# Test with your actual values
curl "http://localhost:8000/v1/get_latest_block?chain_id=40319"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow Response Times">

**Symptoms:** Queries taking 30+ seconds to respond

**Solutions:**
1. **Check network latency:** Permissioned networks may have geographic delays
2. **Optimize query scope:** Ask for specific time ranges instead of "all time"
3. **Use pagination:** For large datasets, request smaller chunks
4. **Monitor API limits:** SettleMint may have rate limiting

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Transaction Data">

**Symptoms:** Recent transactions not appearing in results

**Solutions:**
1. **Check indexing delay:** Blockscout may take 1-2 minutes to index new blocks
2. **Verify block confirmations:** Very recent transactions might not be finalized
3. **Confirm transaction success:** Failed transactions may not appear in some queries
4. **Check address format:** Ensure proper checksum formatting for addresses

</Accordion>
</Accordions>
