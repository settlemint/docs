## Enterprise infrastructure planning overview

Planning enterprise blockchain infrastructure requires careful consideration of performance, security, compliance, and total cost of ownership. This guide provides detailed requirements for production-grade SettleMint deployments.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Enterprise Resource Planning**
  
  The requirements listed below are for the core platform components only. Additional resources will be needed for:
  - Prerequisites (databases, monitoring, security services)
  - Blockchain services you plan to deploy
  - High availability and disaster recovery systems
  - Development, staging, and production environments
</Callout>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do I calculate total cost of ownership for enterprise blockchain infrastructure?">
    Enterprise TCO includes compute costs, storage costs, network bandwidth, administrative overhead, monitoring tools, backup storage, disaster recovery infrastructure, and professional services. Plan for 3x base requirements to account for HA, DR, and multiple environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What compliance considerations affect infrastructure sizing?">
    Compliance requirements like SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA may require additional logging infrastructure, backup storage, audit trail systems, and separate environments for different data classifications. This can increase infrastructure requirements by 50-100%.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I plan for blockchain network growth over time?">
    Blockchain networks grow continuously. Plan for 30% annual growth in storage and compute. Some enterprise customers see 2-3x growth in the first year as adoption increases across business units.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## What network infrastructure do I need for enterprise blockchain security?

Enterprise blockchain deployments require robust network security, compliance capabilities, and high availability. The platform requires specific network configurations to ensure secure and reliable communication between components:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div>
    ### Connectivity

    - **Internet Access**: Required for pulling container images and updates
    - **Load Balancer**: For distributing traffic across nodes
    - **Ingress Controller**: For routing external traffic
    - **SSL/TLS**: Valid certificates for secure communication

  </div>

  <div>
    ### Required Ports

    - **80/443**: HTTP/HTTPS traffic

    - **Backup Storage**: Equal to primary storage
    - **Monitoring**: Implement storage usage alerts

  </div>
</div>

<Callout>
### Storage best practices

- Use separate volumes for different components
- Implement regular backup procedures
- Monitor storage performance metrics
- Set up alerts for capacity thresholds

</Callout>

## Prerequisites resource requirements

<Callout type="info">
  When hosting prerequisites on the same infrastructure, these requirements must
  be added to the base platform specifications. Each component can be hosted
  separately or together depending on your architecture.

- Monitoring and logging overhead
- Backup storage requirements
- Scaling headroom for growth

</Callout>

### Total resource summary

For a production setup hosting both platform and prerequisites:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div>
    ### CPU

    - Platform: 8 cores
    - Prerequisites: 8 cores
    - **Total: 16+ cores**

  </div>

  <div>
    ### RAM

    - Platform: 32GB
    - Prerequisites: 20GB
    - **Total: 52GB+**

  </div>

  <div>
    ### Storage

    - Platform: 250GB
    - Prerequisites: 190GB
    - **Total: 440GB+**

  </div>
</div>

## Service requirements

The platform allows you to deploy services in two ways:

1. On the same cluster as the platform
2. On separate target clusters

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div>
    ### Same Cluster Deployment

    If you plan to deploy services on the same cluster as the platform:

    - Add service requirements to the platform requirements
    - Include them in capacity planning
    - Account for resource overhead
    - Plan for scaling headroom

  </div>

  <div>
    ### Target Cluster Deployment

    Using separate target clusters for services:

    - Keeps platform and service workloads isolated
    - Requires separate infrastructure planning
    - Can be optimized for specific service needs
    - Enables geographic distribution

  </div>
</div>

<Callout>
### Infrastructure planning strategy
We recommend:

1. List all services you plan to deploy
2. Decide on deployment strategy (same cluster or target clusters)
3. For same cluster: Add service requirements to platform requirements
4. For target clusters: Plan separate infrastructure
5. Include 30% buffer for growth and peak loads
