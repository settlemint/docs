<Callout type="info">
**Quick Application Setup**: Create your first blockchain application in under 2 minutes. Organizations provide team collaboration, billing management, and project organization - everything needed for enterprise blockchain development.
</Callout>

<Callout type="question">
**Common Question**: "What's the difference between an organization and an application? How should I structure my blockchain projects?"
</Callout>

**Answer**:
- **Organization** = Your company/team workspace with billing, members, and permissions
- **Application** = Individual blockchain project (like a dApp, smart contract suite, or use case)
- **Best practice**: One organization per company, multiple applications per use case

## Why do you need to understand SettleMint's project structure?

<Callout type="question">
**Common Question**: "I just want to deploy smart contracts. Why do I need to set up organizations and applications first?"
</Callout>

**Answer**: SettleMint's structure enables enterprise-grade blockchain development with proper governance, team collaboration, and cost management from day one. This prevents common issues like unclear billing, security gaps, and deployment chaos.

### SettleMint hierarchy explained

![Organization and applications](/images/btp/building-with-settlemint/organization_and_application.png)

**Enterprise Structure Benefits:**

- **🏢 Organization-level billing** - Clear cost allocation per team/client
- **👥 Role-based access control** - Secure team collaboration
- **📋 Project isolation** - Separate environments prevent conflicts
- **📊 Usage tracking** - Monitor resources across all projects

### When to create multiple organizations

**Recommended structure**:
- **One organization per company/department** for billing and governance
- **Multiple applications per organization** for different use cases
- **Example**: "Acme Corp" organization with "Supply Chain", "Payments", and "Identity" applications

## Create an organization

Navigate to the **homepage**, or click the **grid icon** in the upper right corner.

Click **create new organization**. This opens a form. Follow these steps to create your organization:

Choose a **name** for your organization. Choose a name that is easily recognizable in your dashboards, e.g. your company name, department name, team name, etc. You can change the name of your organization at any time.

![Add organization](/images/btp/building-with-settlemint/add-organization.png)

Enter **billing information**. SettleMint creates a billing account for this organization. You will be billed monthly for the resources you use within this organization. Provide your billing details securely via Stripe, with support for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex, to activate your organization. Follow the prompts to complete the setup and gain full access to SettleMint's blockchain development tools. Ensure all details are accurate to enable a smooth onboarding experience. Your organization is billed monthly, with the invoice dates set for 1st of every month.

![SettleMint Signup](/images/btp/building-with-settlemint/create-org-billing.png)

Click **confirm** to go to the organization dashboard. From here, you can create
your first application in this organization. The dashboard will show you a
summary of your organization's applications, the members in this organization,
and a status of the resource costs for the current month.

When you create an organization, you are the owner, and therefore an
administrator of the organization. This means you can perform all actions within
this organization, with no limitations.

## Invite new organization members

![Invite members](/images/btp/building-with-settlemint/invite-member-to-org.png)

Navigate to the **members section** of your organization, via the homepage, or
via your organization dashboard.

Follow these steps to invite new members to your organization:

1. Click **invite new member**.
2. Enter the **email adress** of the person you want to invite.
3. Select their **role**, i.e. whether they will be an administrator or a user.
4. Optionally, you can add a **message** to be included in the invitation email.
5. Click **confirm** to go to the list of your organization's members. Your
   email invitation has now been sent, and you see in the list that it is
   pending.

## Manage an organization

Navigate to the **organization dashboard**.

Click **manage organization** to see the available actions. You can only perform
these actions if you have administrator rights for this organization.

- **change name** - Changes the organization name without any further impact.
- **delete organization** - Removes the organization from the platform.

On organization dashboard

- See all applications in that organization.
- See all members of the organization
- See all the internal applications and clients if in partner mode

:::warning Warning

You can only delete an organization when it has no applications related to it.
Applications have to be deleted one by one, once all their related resources
(e.g. networks, nodes, smart contract sets, etc.) have been deleted.

:::

## Create an application

An application is the context in which you organize your networks, nodes, smart
contract sets and any other related blockchain resource.

<Callout type="info">
  You will always need to create an application before you can deploy or join
  networks, and add nodes.
</Callout>

## Manage an application

The SettleMint platform dashboard provides a centralized view of blockchain
infrastructure, offering real-time insights into system components. With health
status indicators, including error and warning counts, it ensures system
stability while enabling users to proactively address potential issues. Resource
usage tracking helps manage costs efficiently, providing month-to-date expense
insights.

Each component features a "details" link for quick access to in-depth
information, while the intuitive navigation panel allows seamless access to key
modules such as audit logs, access tokens, and insights. Built-in support
options further enhance usability, ensuring users can quickly troubleshoot and
resolve issues.
