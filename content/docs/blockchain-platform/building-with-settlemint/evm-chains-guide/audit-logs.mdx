The audit log keeps a detailed record of user actions across the system, helping
teams monitor activity, track changes, and stay compliant with internal and
external requirements. Each entry includes a timestamp, showing exactly when
something was done, which makes it easier to follow the flow of events and spot
any irregularities.

It also records the user who performed the action, adding a layer of
accountability by linking every change to a specific individual or system role.
This is especially useful when reviewing changes or troubleshooting unexpected
behavior.

The service field highlights which part of the platform was involved, whether
it’s an integration, middleware component, or another system area. Alongside
that, the action field captures what was done, like creating, editing, or
deleting something. Together, these fields give teams a clear snapshot of what
happened, where, and by whom.
