## Production Workflow Implementation

<Callout type="info" title="Enterprise Best Practices">
Before building custom workflows, review our [Node-RED enterprise guide](https://nodered.org/docs/tutorials/first-flow) for production-ready development patterns and security considerations.
</Callout>

### Real-World Enterprise Example

This comprehensive example demonstrates building a **production-ready blockchain API endpoint** using SettleMint's Integration Studio. We'll create an enterprise-grade service to query the latest block number from a Polygon Mumbai network, showcasing the platform's capabilities for **real-time blockchain data access**.

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a [Polygon Mumbai Node deployed](/platfrom-components/add-a-node-to-a-network) within your SettleMint application for this enterprise integration example.

<Steps>
### Add http input node
Drag and drop a **Http In node** to listen for requests. If you double-click the node, you will see you have a couple parameters to set:

- `METHOD` - set it to `GET`. This is HTTP Method that your node is configured
  to listen to.
- `URL` - set it to `/getLatestBlock`. This the endpoint that your node will
  listen to.

### Add function node

Drag and drop a **function node**. This is the node that will query the
blockchain for the block number. Double-click the node to configure it.

<Callout>
`rpcEndpoint` is the RPC url of your Polygon Mumbai Node.
Under the **Connect tab** of your Polygon Mumbai node, you will find its RPC url.

`accessToken` - You will need an access token for your application. If you do
not have one, you can easily
[create an access token](/platfrom-components/application-access-tokens) first.

</Callout>

Enter the following snippet in the Message tab:

```javascript
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Configuration                                         //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

const rpcEndpoint = "https://YOUR_NODE_RPC_ENDPOINT.settlemint.com";
const accessToken = "YOUR_APPLICATION_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE";

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Logic                                                 //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

const ethers = global.get("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  `${rpcEndpoint}/${accessToken}`
);
msg.payload = await provider.getBlockNumber();

return msg;

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// End                                                   //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** ethers and some ipfs libraries are already available by default and can be used like this:

```javascript
const ethers = global.get("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  `${rpcEndpoint}/${accessToken}`
);

const ipfsHttpClient = global.get("ipfsHttpClient");
const client = ipfsHttpClient.create(`${ipfsEndpoint}/${accessToken}/api/v0`);

const uint8arrays = global.get("uint8arrays");
const itAll = global.get("itAll");
const data = uint8arrays.toString(
  uint8arrays.concat(await itAll(client.cat(cid)))
);
```

If the library you need isn't available by default you will need to import it in
the setup tab. Example for ethers providers:
![Ethers Project Import](/images/btp/document360/Images/ethers-project-import.png)

</Callout>

### Add http response node

Drag and drop a **Http Response node** to reply to the request. Double-click and
configure:

- `Status code` - This is the HTTP status code that the node will respond with
  after completion of the request. We set it to 200 (`OK`)

Click on the `Deploy` button in the top right corner to save and deploy your
changes.

### Test your endpoint

Now, go back to the **Connect tab** of your Integration Studio to see your **API
endpoint**, which looks something like
`https://YOUR_INTEGRATION_STUDIO_API_URL.settlemint.com`.

You can now send requests to
`https://YOUR_INTEGRATION_STUDIO_API_URL.settlemint.com/getLatestBlock` to get
the latest block number. Do not forget to create an API Key for your Integration
studio and pass it as the `x-auth-token` authorization header with your request.

Example terminal command:

```bash
curl -H "x-auth-token: bpaas-YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY_HERE" https://YOUR_INTEGRATION_STUDIO_API_URL.settlemint.com/getLatestBlock
```

</Steps>
