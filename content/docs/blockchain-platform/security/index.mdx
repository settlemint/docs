## What security frameworks does SettleMint implement?

<Tabs items={['Zero-Trust Security', 'Compliance Standards', 'Threat Mitigation']}>
  <Tab value="Zero-Trust Security">
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all privileged access
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions based on job functions
    - **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and behavioral analytics
    - **Network Segmentation**: Micro-segmentation for blockchain node isolation
    - **Identity Verification**: Hardware security keys and biometric authentication
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Compliance Standards">
    - **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management System certification
    - **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
    - **GDPR & CCPA**: Data privacy and protection compliance
    - **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standards
    - **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module validation
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Threat Mitigation">
    - **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Protection**: Nation-state level threat defense
    - **Crypto-Jacking Prevention**: Mining malware detection and prevention
    - **Smart Contract Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and formal verification
    - **Supply Chain Security**: Software bill of materials (SBOM) and dependency scanning
    - **Insider Threat Protection**: Privileged access monitoring and anomaly detection
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How does SettleMint protect against blockchain-specific threats?

Enterprise blockchain deployments face unique security challenges that traditional IT security cannot address:

- **51% Attacks**: Consensus mechanism protection and network distribution
- **Private Key Compromise**: Hardware security modules (HSM) and multi-signature wallets
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Formal verification and automated security testing
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Decentralized oracle networks and data validation
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Security**: Multi-signature validation and time-lock mechanisms

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical Security Consideration**: Enterprise blockchain security requires specialized knowledge of cryptographic protocols, consensus mechanisms, and distributed system vulnerabilities that differ significantly from traditional web application security.
