# The basics

It uses Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that developers can deploy
their existing Ethereum dapps to Optimism without any changes. In addition to
scalability and compatibility, Optimism is also focused on decentralization. The
Optimism network is secured by a decentralized network of validators, and it is
governed by a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This ensures that
Optimism is not controlled by any single entity.

## Why choose optimistic rollups for your Layer 2 strategy?

Optimism's optimistic rollup technology provides a balanced approach to scaling, prioritizing security and simplicity while delivering significant performance improvements.

### Optimistic Rollup Benefits

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Optimistic Execution**
    
    Transactions are assumed valid by default, enabling fast processing without complex validity proofs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Fraud Proof Security**
    
    Anyone can challenge invalid transactions during a 7-day window, ensuring network security through economic incentives.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **EVM Equivalence**
    
    Full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility means existing contracts deploy without modification.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Ethereum Settlement**
    
    Final settlement on Ethereum mainnet provides ultimate security and decentralization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### OP Stack: Modular Blockchain Infrastructure
