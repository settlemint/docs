title: "GDPR Compliance"
---

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive privacy
regulation that governs the collection, processing, and storage of personal data
within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). As a
European company building a blockchain application, it is essential to ensure
your application complies with GDPR regulations. This documentation will outline
key considerations and provide guidance for achieving compliance.

<br></br>
To support our clients in aligning with GDPR requirements, SettleMint provides
platform-level features and architectural best practices that help ensure
privacy, security, and regulatory alignment while building decentralized
applications.

## Key considerations

### 1. Data minimization

Under GDPR, companies must practice data minimization, collecting and processing
only what is necessary for a specific, declared purpose. Blockchain’s inherent
immutability introduces challenges here.

SettleMint supports this principle by:

- Providing integrated off-chain storage modules where sensitive user data can
  be stored securely, keeping only cryptographic references or hashes on-chain.
- Allowing developers to configure smart contracts to avoid direct storage of
  personally identifiable information (PII).

**Best practices suggested:**

- Store only deterministic hashes or proofs on-chain.
- Use secure IPFS or cloud connectors to manage off-chain personal data.

---

### 2. Identifying data controllers and data processors

GDPR requires clear distinction between **data controllers** (who determine the
purpose and means of processing) and **data processors** (who act on behalf of
controllers).

On the SettleMint platform:

- Access roles and data flows can be clearly modeled using permissioned
  blockchain channels.
- Organizations on a blockchain network can be mapped to controller/processor
  roles via Membership Service Provider (MSP) structures.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Maintain a registry of actors and their responsibilities in your governance
  model.
- Document data processing agreements between consortium members.

### 3. Right to erasure (Right to be Forgotten)

The immutability of blockchain makes deletion of personal data difficult or
impossible.

SettleMint addresses this challenge through:

- Off-chain personal data storage, enabling full erasure of user data without
  breaking blockchain references.
- Support for advanced cryptographic patterns such as zero-knowledge proofs and
  hashed identifiers to make data unlinkable.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Never store raw PII on-chain.
- Design smart contracts to support revocation and pointer invalidation
  mechanisms.

---

### 4. Pseudonymization and anonymization

SettleMint enables privacy-by-design through data transformation tools that
support:

- **Pseudonymization**: Replacing user identifiers with random tokens or
  blockchain addresses.
- **Anonymization**: Removing or irreversibly altering PII such that it cannot
  be re-linked.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Use public-private key pairs to abstract identities.
- Avoid reusing pseudonyms across different datasets.

---

### 5. Consent management

GDPR mandates that users provide clear and revocable consent for processing
their personal data.

SettleMint provides application kits and templates for:

- Building smart contract-based consent registries that are transparent and
  auditable.
- Logging and timestamping user consent and withdrawals immutably, while storing
  detailed consent data off-chain.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Design explicit consent flows in the application UI.
- Allow users to view and manage consent history via self-sovereign identity
  interfaces.

---

### 6. Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

A DPIA is essential to proactively assess and mitigate privacy risks.

SettleMint supports DPIA efforts by:

- Providing visual workflows and configuration templates that help document data
  flows, access levels, and risk areas.
- Enabling rapid prototyping and simulation of data processing within your
  decentralized architecture.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Use DPIA templates early in the design phase.
- Update DPIA documentation with each chaincode upgrade or network policy
  change.

---

### 7. Cross-border transfers

Transfers of personal data outside the EU/EEA require appropriate safeguards
such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).

For permissioned blockchains built with SettleMint:

- Data residency policies can be enforced through organization-specific data
  nodes and localized off-chain storage.
- Data access policies can be enforced through Fabric/Quorum consortium rules
  and smart contract-level whitelisting.

**Best practices suggested:**

- Ensure all network participants agree to and implement SCCs where applicable.
- Architect the network with geographic boundaries in mind when dealing with
  sensitive user data.

## SettleMint’s GDPR-aligned features

SettleMint is committed to privacy-first blockchain development and offers the
following GDPR-supportive features:

- **Off-chain Secure Data Vaults**: Integration with IPFS, cloud, and database
  connectors for compliant data storage.
- **Zero-knowledge Pattern Support**: Capability to implement zk-proofs, Merkle
  proofs, and hashed pointers to minimize on-chain data exposure.
- **Granular Access Controls**: Role-based access, smart contract permissions,
  and organization-level policies enforce strict data governance.
- **Audit Logging and Consent Trails**: Tamper-proof registries to track user
  consent and system actions in accordance with GDPR transparency requirements.
- **Chaincode Lifecycle Management**: Ensures that every upgrade or change in
  data logic is reviewed, versioned, and auditable.
