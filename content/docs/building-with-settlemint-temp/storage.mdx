Managing complex or large data in decentralized systems can be a challenge. To securely store and share your files and data, SettleMint offers two storage solutions that can interact with the blockchain: **IPFS (decentralized)** and **MinIO (centralized)**.

## Add Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to the **application** where you want to add storage. Click **Storage** in the left navigation, and then click **Add storage**. This opens a form.

    <Steps>
      ### Configure Storage
      1. Choose storage type (IPFS or MinIO)
      2. Choose a **Storage name**
      3. Configure deployment settings
      4. Click **Confirm**
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First ensure you're authenticated:
    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    Create storage:
    ```bash
    # Get the list of available storage types
    settlemint platform create storage --help

    # Create storage
    settlemint platform create storage <type> <name>

    # Get information about the command and all available options
    settlemint platform create storage <type> --help
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    For a full example of how to connect to a storage using the SDK, see the [MinIO SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-minio#api-reference) or [IPFS SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-ipfs#api-reference).

    <Callout type="info">
    Get your access token from the Platform UI under User Settings â†’ API Tokens.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
    The SDK enables you to:
    - Use IPFS for decentralized storage - check out the [IPFS SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/ipfs)
    - Use MinIO for S3-compatible storage - check out the [MinIO SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/minio)
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to your storage and click **Manage storage** to:
    - View storage details and status
    - Monitor health
    - Access storage interface
    - Update configurations
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List storage instances
    settlemint platform list storage --application <app-name>

    # Get storage details
    settlemint platform read storage <name>

    # Delete storage
    settlemint platform delete storage <name>
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List storage instances
    const listStorage = async () => {
      const storages = await client.storage.list("your-app-id");
      console.log('Storage instances:', storages);
    };

    // Get storage details
    const getStorage = async () => {
      const storage = await client.storage.read("storage-unique-name");
      console.log('Storage details:', storage);
    };

    // Delete storage
    const deleteStorage = async () => {
      await client.storage.delete("storage-unique-name");
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## About IPFS (decentralized)

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. When uploading a file to IPFS it generates a unique fingerprint (hash). Later when querying that data it will use that fingerprint to find nodes storing the data behind this fingerprint. This means that this hash is not only a key used to retrieve a file, but it also serves as a proof of integrity. Often such fingerprints will be stored on chain in order to act as a bridge between the blockchain and IPFS.

[Learn more on IPFS here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/)

## About MinIO (centralized - S3 compatible)

For private or confidential data, MinIO would be your preferred option.

[Learn more on MinIO here](https://min.io/)

MinIO is S3-compatible. If you want to **set up a MinIO client for AWS S3**, you need these parameters:

**endPoint**
The endpoint is the URL to object storage service. Example value: example-minio-123a.settlemint.com, unique-name.settlemint.com (you can get the unique name from the Details tab)

**accessKey**
The access key is like a user ID that uniquely identifies your account. You can get your access key under the **Connect tab**

**secretKey**
The secret key is like the password to your account. You can get your secret key under the **Connect tab**.

```js
var Minio = require('minio');

var s3Client = new Minio.Client({
  endPoint: 'your-minio-instance.settlemint.com',
  accessKey: 'YOUR-ACCESSKEYID',
  secretKey: 'YOUR-SECRETACCESSKEY'
});
```

You can now use the s3Client object to call methods like `makeBucket`, `getObject`, and [many more methods which you can find here](https://docs.min.io/docs/javascript-client-api-reference.html).

<Callout type="info">
MinIO client can also be configured in Python, .NET, Java, Golang, Haskell. You can follow the [quickstart guides provided by MinIO here](https://docs.min.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide.html) for more information.
