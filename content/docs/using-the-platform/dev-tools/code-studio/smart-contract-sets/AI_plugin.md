The integration of an OpenAI GPT plugin into the Smart Contract Set of the SettleMint platform brings forth significant advantages for the fast development of new smart contracts. Generative AI technology empowers developers by providing them with automated code suggestions, smart contract templates, and code completion capabilities. This accelerates the development process by reducing manual effort and improving code efficiency.

Additionally, the interactive debugging and explanation features offered by the GPT plugin greatly benefit developers of all skill levels. Beginners can leverage the plugin's explanations to understand complex concepts, improve their coding skills, and gain insights into best practices. Experienced developers can utilize the debugging features to quickly identify and resolve issues, leading to more robust and error-free smart contracts.

Overall, the integration of the OpenAI GPT plugin into the SettleMint platform's Smart Contract IDE combines the power of generative AI and interactive debugging to enhance productivity, code quality, and learning opportunities for developers in the blockchain space.

You can find this plugin in the sidebar (magic lamp icon), in context menu and the action panel. The first time you use the plugin you will get asked for an OpenAI API key. Depending on your OpenAI API access you can use the default GPT 3.5 model or the GPT 4 model which is slower, but more accurate. Check out the settings in the IDE to configure this and other settings (like using your own Azure GPT service)

Here are some prompts to get you started:

- Write a Solidity ERC20 token representing a bond, based on OpenZeppelin. Include a bond repayment and coupon payments.
- Write a Solidity ERC721 token representing real estate, based on OpenZeppelin and allow fractional ownership of this NFT in the form of ERC20 tokens.
- Write The Graph indexing code that indexes an ERC721 token on the Ethereum Mainnet.
