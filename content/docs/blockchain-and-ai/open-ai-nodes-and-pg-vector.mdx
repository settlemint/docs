### Step 1: Design Enterprise Vector Database Schema

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What database schema supports enterprise blockchain analytics?">

**Optimized Hasura Schema for Blockchain Intelligence:**

<Steps>
<Step>
**Smart Contract Embeddings Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE smart_contract_embeddings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  contract_address TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  blockchain_network TEXT NOT NULL,
  contract_name TEXT,
  contract_source_code TEXT,
  embedding vector(1536),
  deployment_block BIGINT,
  creator_address TEXT,
  creation_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  security_score NUMERIC,
  gas_efficiency_rating NUMERIC,
  
  -- Indexes for fast similarity search
  INDEX ON embedding USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops),

### Step 4: Vectorize Data with OpenAI Node

1. **Insert an OpenAI Node** in the workflow:
   - Use this node to generate vector embeddings for the text data using
     OpenAI's Embedding API.
   - Configure the OpenAI node to use the appropriate model and input data, such
     as `text-embedding-ada-002`.

![Create an OpenAI node](../../img/developer-guides/openai-node.png)

### Step 5: Store Vectors in Hasura with pgvector

1. **Add a GraphQL Node** to save the vector embeddings and data `id` in Hasura.
2. Set up a **GraphQL Mutation** to store the vectors and associated IDs in a
   table enabled with `pgvector`.

Example Mutation:

```graphql
mutation insertVector($id: uuid!, $vector: [Float!]!) {
  insert_vectors(objects: { id: $id, vector: $vector }) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

3. Ensure correct data mapping from the fetched data and vectorized output.

### Step 6: Deploy and Test the Workflow

1. **Deploy the Flow** within Integration Studio and **run it** to confirm that
   data is fetched, vectorized, and stored in Hasura.
2. **Verify Hasura Data** by checking the table to ensure vectorized entries and
   corresponding IDs are stored correctly.

## Part 2: Setting Up a Similarity Search Endpoint

### Step 1: Create a POST Endpoint

1. **Add an HTTP POST Node** to accept a JSON payload with a `query` string to
   be vectorized and compared to stored data.

Payload Example:

```json
{
  "query": "input string for similarity search"
}
```

2. **Parse the Request** by adding a JSON node to extract the `query` field from
   the incoming POST request.

### Step 2: Vectorize the Input Query

1. **Add an OpenAI Node** to convert the incoming `query` string into a vector
   representation.

Example Configuration:

```text
Model: text-embedding-ada-002
Input: {{msg.payload.query}}
```

### Step 3: Perform a Similarity Search with Hasura

1. **Add a GraphQL Node** to perform a vector similarity search within Hasura
   using the `pgvector` plugin.
2. Use a **GraphQL Query** to order results by similarity, returning the top 5
   most similar records.

Example Query:

```graphql
query searchVectors($vector: [Float!]!) {
  vectors(order_by: { vector: { _vector_distance: $vector } }, limit: 5) {
    id
    vector
  }
}
```

3. Map the vector from the OpenAI node output as the `vector` input for the
   Hasura query.

### Step 4: Format and Return the Results

1. **Add a Function Node** to format the response, listing the top 5 matches in
   a structured JSON format.

### Step 5: Test the Flow

1. **Deploy the Flow** and send a POST request to confirm the similarity search
   functionality.
2. **Verify Response** to ensure that the flow accurately returns the top 5
   matches from the vectorized data in Hasura.
