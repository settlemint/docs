  don’t need a local environment—resulting in a frictionless dev experience.

## **Smart Contract API Portal**
After deployment, the **Smart Contract API Portal** translates your contract
ABIs into **REST** and **GraphQL** endpoints—often termed “write middleware”
because they allow writing data on-chain through these automatically generated
APIs. It includes:

- **OpenAPI Documentation:** So you can test endpoints directly in the browser.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easily check function parameters and event outputs.
- **Hundreds of Endpoints per Contract:** Eliminating the need to manually code
  them. This shortens the time from contract deployment to integration with
  front ends or third-party services.

## **Graph Middleware**
**Graph Middleware** accelerates read operations by indexing specified on-chain
data in real time. Developers define subgraphs that specify which events,
transactions, and states to monitor, enabling quick data retrieval via GraphQL.
Popular for:

- **DeFi Dashboards**
- **NFT Marketplaces**
- **Real-time Analytics** By removing the need to scan entire blockchains
  manually, Graph Middleware makes complex queries simple and efficient.

## **Ethereum Attestation Indexer**
Enterprise solutions often require **verifiable credentials** (e.g., identity
attestations or compliance confirmations). The **Ethereum Attestation Indexer**
monitors and indexes data produced by the **Ethereum Attestation Service
(EAS)**. It then presents these attestations through a GraphQL API, allowing:

- **Identity Verification**
- **Reputation Systems**
- **Regulatory Tracking** This specialized middleware simplifies trust-based
  interactions, reducing custom code for indexing or auditing attestations.

## **Integration Studio**
The **Integration Studio** is a **low-code, Node-RED-based** environment for
orchestrating cross-system workflows:

- **4,000+ Pre-Built Connectors:** Link blockchains to ERP, CRM, HR, AI/ML, and
  other external systems.
- **Event-Driven Processes:** React to on-chain activities by triggering
  off-chain actions, such as sending emails or updating databases.
- **API Management:** Expose blockchain functions as RESTful endpoints or
  incorporate external APIs into on-chain processes. This reduces the need for
  heavy custom coding when bridging decentralized and centralized systems.

## **Hasura GraphQL Engine**
**Hasura** seamlessly manages **off-chain** data—often user details,
authentication, or large volumes of records that don’t need to reside on-chain.
Paired with a PostgreSQL database, Hasura automatically generates a **real-time
GraphQL schema**, offering:

- **Instant Queries & Mutations**
- **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Real-Time Updates** for dashboards and front ends By decoupling large or
  frequently changing data from blockchain storage, you optimize both
  performance and cost while retaining cryptographic proof references on-chain
  as needed.

## **S3 Storage (MinIO)**
For storing large files—such as logs, digital certificates, transaction
receipts—SettleMint offers an **S3-compatible MinIO** service. You can:

- **Upload & Retrieve Files via Standard S3 APIs**
- **Control Access Permissions**
- **Benefit from High-Performance Object Storage** It’s ideal for data that
  doesn’t require on-chain immutability or public distribution (unlike IPFS).
  Typical use cases include operational logs, user-generated content, and
  archives that must remain accessible and secure.

## **IPFS Storage**
SettleMint integrates **IPFS** for **decentralized**, **tamper-proof** file
storage. A unique hash (CID) identifies each file, enabling:

- **Verified Authenticity:** Hash-based references confirm file content hasn’t
  changed.
- **Permanent Distribution:** Files remain online as long as peers host them,
  removing dependency on a single provider.
- **Ideal for NFTs, Public Certificates, and Audit Logs** that require trustless
  verification. By offloading large files to IPFS and storing only the hash
  on-chain, you can preserve blockchain efficiency while retaining provable data
  integrity.

## **Private Key Management**
Depending on risk, compliance requirements, and scale, SettleMint supports
multiple approaches:

  from a master seed for structured backups.
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Tamper-resistant devices ensuring
  maximum security for enterprise or regulated use cases. Each approach
  integrates with the **Transaction Signer**, guaranteeing seamless and secure
  execution of on-chain operations.

## **Access Tokens (PAT/AAT)**
Two forms of token-based authentication and authorization:

- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs):** Tied to individual users for tasks like
  contract deployment, node setup, or platform configuration.
- **Application Access Tokens (AATs):** For machine-to-machine interactions,
  often used by microservices or scripts that require secure blockchain access.
  Admins can create, rotate, or revoke tokens, applying granular role-based
  controls to ensure only authorized entities interact with the network.

## **Custom Deployments**
SettleMint enables developers to containerize custom applications—front-end
dashboards, specialized microservices, or custom oracles—and host them within
the platform. You can:

- **Define Container Images & Environments**
- **Configure Domains & SSL**
- **Scale Resources** based on user traffic This integrated approach eliminates
  the need for separate hosting services, simplifying operational overhead and
  unifying observability.
