## How do I integrate the frontend and business logic?

### Open development environment

To add and edit the smart contract code, you will use the IDE.

![Open Fullscreen](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/open-fullscreen.png)

Once the resource has been deployed, select the `IDE` tab and then
`View in fullscreen mode`.

### 3. Adding the smart contract code

With the IDE open in fullscreen, create a new file for your Asset Tokenization
smart contract.

![Create Asset Contract](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/create-asset-contract.png)

1. On the File Explorer on the left side, select the `Contracts` option.
2. Right Click and select `New File...`
3. Create a new file called `AssetTokenization.sol`

Before adding the contract code, you'll need to install the OpenZeppelin
contracts dependency. This provides the base contracts we'll inherit from for
features like upgradability and access control.

Open the terminal in the IDE and run:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
```

This package provides the base contracts we'll use like `UUPSUpgradeable`,
`OwnableUpgradeable`, and `ERC1155SupplyUpgradeable`.

After installing the dependency, copy and paste the Solidity code below:

</details>

### 4. Change the deployment configuration

With the code pasted in the IDE, you now need to change the deployment settings
to include the smart contract you have just created.

![Edit Deployment Contract](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/edit-deploy.png)

In the file explorer on the left, select the `ignition` folder. Then open the
`main.ts` file under `modules`.

Replace the content of `main.ts` with the code below:

<details>
    <summary> Ignition Module Code </summary>

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// SettleMint.com
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

const AssetTokenizationModule = buildModule("AssetTokenizationModule", (m) => {
  const assetTokenization = m.contract("AssetTokenization");

  return { assetTokenization };
});

export default AssetTokenizationModule;
```

</details>

### 5. Deploy the contract

With those settings changed, you are now ready to compile and deploy your smart
contract.

![Compile Contract](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/compile-contract.png)

### 5. Interact with the smart contract

The Integration Studio allows you to interact with your smart contract and add business logic.
Go to the newly created `Asset Tokenisation` tab in the Integration Studio.

![Asset Imported](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/asset-imported.png)

The first function you need to complete is to set the global variables of the integration.

![Set Global Variables](./../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/set-global-variables.gif)

To do this, click on the middle item in the diagram labeled `Set Global Variables`. There you will you a variable called `glbVar`. Here is where you will enter the information to start interacting with your smart contract.

![Set Global Variables](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/globalvariables-settings.png)

1. **privateKey** - Enter your private key that you created in [Part 1 / Step 4](#4-deploy-a-private-key)
2. **privateKeyAdress** - The address created after completing [Part 1 / Step 4](#4-deploy-a-private-key)
3. **smartContract** - The address of your deployed smart contract after completing [Part 2 / Step 5](#5-deploy-the-contract)
4. **accessToken** - The API key created when completing [Part 3 / Step 3](#3-creating-an-access-token)
5. **rpcEndpoint** - The JSON RPC URL that was shown when completing [Part 3 / Step 2](#2-get-the-json-rpc-endpoint)

With this information entered, click on the blue square next to the `Inject` item.

Now you need to create an asset by creating an asset name, asset symbol and assetUri.

![Change Asset Name](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/assetname.gif)

To create an asset, double click on the `Inject` option next to the `Initialise Asset` item.

In this window you can set:
**msg.assetName** - Bond
**msg.assetSymbol** - BND
**msg.assetUri** - The IPFS URL of the asset you created after completing [Part 3 / Step 1](#1-upload-an-image-to-ipfs)

From here you can now click on the other `inject` options to:

1. Create an Asset
2. View the Asset
3. Mint the Asset
4. View the Balance

![Asset Name](../../img/developer-guides/asset-tokenization/asset-debug.png)

To see how the interactions with your smart contract, choose the `Debug` option under the deploy button.
