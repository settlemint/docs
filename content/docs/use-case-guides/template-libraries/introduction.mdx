## Important Notes Before Usage

<Callout type="warning" title="Please review before use">
  These templates are <strong>reference implementations</strong>, not
  ready-to-deploy production contracts or chaincode. Always customize and test
  thoroughly before using in any live or sensitive environment.
</Callout>

**Key cautions:**

- **Security**: Templates should be audited for your use case and environment
  specifics. Critical paths like funds transfer or permission control must be
  reviewed manually and/or formally verified.
- **Customization Required**: The templates are generic. Specific business
  logic, regulatory constraints, and contract-specific behaviors must be
  implemented manually.
- **Resource Considerations**: Smart contract templates must be gas-efficient
  (EVM), and Fabric templates must avoid long execution or response times due to
  chaincode lifecycle constraints.
- **Environment Sensitivity**: Test on devnets (e.g., Ganache, local Fabric)
  before deploying on public/mainnet infrastructure.

---

## Best Practices for Template Adoption

### 1. **Separate Core Logic and Permissions**

- Define role-based modifiers (Solidity) or access logic (GoLang) as reusable
  layers
- Avoid embedded ACLs in core business functions to maintain clarity and
  auditability

### 2. **Follow Transactional Boundaries**

- In Fabric: Avoid multiple read/write invocations inside a loop unless
  atomicity is ensured
- In EVM: Minimize state changes per call to avoid unnecessary gas consumption
  or complexity

### 3. **Structure Events Consistently**

- Use semantic, structured event naming (`ProfileCreated`, `AssetTransferred`)
- Emit key identifiers and indexes for off-chain sync and indexing systems
  (e.g., The Graph, Kafka listeners)

### 4. **Leverage Strong Typing in TypeScript SDKs**

- Use typed interfaces for contract interaction and payload schemas
- Ensure runtime error handling for all transaction submission flows and network
  responses

### 5. **Use Version Control for Models**

- Store contract/chaincode hashes and deployment metadata
- Implement migration logic for versioned schema changes in smart contracts or
  ledger records

### 6. **Align With CI/CD and Test Frameworks**

- Add unit and integration tests with frameworks like Mocha, Chai, Jest (for
  TS), and Go test (for Fabric)
- Include basic gas profiling or peer endorsement simulations
- Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar for continuous checks

### 7. **Adopt Secure Development Patterns**

- Avoid dynamic `delegatecall` or unbounded loops in Solidity
- Use Fabric's built-in MSP identity abstraction for managing user roles
- Sanitize and validate all inputs rigorously, both on-chain and at the API
  level

## Languages & Tooling Used

| Template Layer        | Language   | Usage                               |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Smart Contracts (EVM) | Solidity   | Core business logic on-chain        |

## What's Next?

You can now browse specific templates in:

- `EVM Contracts` (Solidity)
- `Fabric Chaincode` (GoLang + TypeScript)

The smart contract and chaincode libraries aim to help developers and teams:

- Move from zero to working logic quickly
- Avoid reinventing core state and ACL patterns
- Align with best practices across Solidity, GoLang, and TypeScript
- Establish a common starting point for internal or client-facing solutions

Use them as a **launchpad**, not an endpoint , always customize to your
environment, test with realistic data, and plan for maintainability and audit
readiness.
