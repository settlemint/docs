title: "Health Records"
---

A healthcare smart contract is a blockchain-based program designed to automate
and securely manage various processes within the healthcare ecosystem, such as
patient data access, provider accreditation, insurance claim processing, and
treatment record keeping. These contracts enforce logic through code, ensuring
that only authorized entities can perform sensitive actions like registering
patients, submitting medical claims, or accessing health records. By using
cryptographic consent and role-based access control, healthcare smart contracts
give patients greater control over their data while reducing the administrative
overhead for providers and insurers. All interactions are logged immutably,
providing transparency and accountability for regulators and auditors.

<br></br>
The use of healthcare smart contracts supports a wide range of applications,
including the creation of national electronic health record systems, streamlined
insurance claim workflows, public health campaign tracking, and secure sharing
of health credentials. These contracts help address major challenges in the
healthcare sector such as data fragmentation, fraud, manual processing delays,
and lack of traceability. They ensure compliance with legal frameworks by
encoding privacy rules directly into the system and by enabling real-time
auditability of care delivery and financial transactions.

## Disclaimer

This smart contract implementation is provided for educational and illustrative
purposes only. It represents a conceptual framework for blockchain-based
healthcare systems.

Key considerations before any production use:

- **Legal Compliance**: healthcare systems are highly regulated and vary
  significantly by jurisdiction. This implementation would require substantial
  modification to meet specific legal requirements in any given location.

- **Security Review**: The contract should undergo comprehensive security
  auditing by qualified blockchain security professionals before handling real
  user or financial transactions.

- **No Warranty**: The authors and contributors disclaim all liability for any
  use of this code. Users assume all risks associated with implementation and
  operation.

- **Consultation Required**: Any organization considering using this template
  should obtain advice from qualified legal counsel, and blockchain security
  experts before deployment.

## Detailed explanation:

---

## 1. Upgradeability and initialization

- **Upgradeable architecture**:  
  The contract uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern to
  allow its implementation to be updated without losing state. The
  `_authorizeUpgrade` function restricts upgrades to addresses that hold the
  `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and ensures that the new implementation address is valid
  (non-zero).

- **Initialization process**:  
  Instead of a traditional constructor, the contract has an `initialize`
  function that:
  - Initializes inherited modules such as access control, upgradeability,
    pausing, and reentrancy guards.
  - Sets up key roles (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `ADMIN_ROLE`, and `AUDITOR_ROLE`)
    with a provided super administrator.
  - Increments the patient ID counter during initialization so that the first
    patient receives an ID of 1, thereby avoiding potential ambiguity with an
    unregistered state.

---

## 2. Access control and role management

- **Defined Roles**:  
  The contract establishes three main roles:

  - **ADMIN_ROLE**: Grants permissions for administrative actions including
    patient and provider registration, status updates, and claim management.
  - **PROVIDER_ROLE**: Assigned to healthcare providers after successful
    registration and accreditation.
  - **AUDITOR_ROLE**: Intended for users responsible for oversight and auditing
    without direct control over system operations.

- **Modifiers for Security**:  
  Several modifiers enforce strict access control and state validations:
  - `onlyActiveProvider`: Ensures that a provider is active and not suspended
    before they can execute certain functions.
  - `onlyValidPatient`: Confirms that a patient is registered by checking for a
    non-zero patient ID.
  - `onlyWithConsent`: Validates that a provider has been granted consent by the
    patient.
  - `validDiagnosisCode`: Checks that a diagnosis code is within the acceptable
    ICD-10 length range (between 3 and 7 characters).

---

## 3. Patient registry

- **Patient Data Structure**:  
  The `Patient` struct holds critical information including:

  - The wallet address.
  - A SHA-3 hashed version of the national ID.
  - An active status flag.
  - Timestamps for registration and the most recent update.

- **Patient registration process**:  
  The `registerPatient` function (accessible only by an admin) performs several
  validations:

  - It confirms that the hashed national ID has not been registered before.
  - It ensures that the wallet address is not already associated with another
    patient.
  - It verifies a government signature (currently a placeholder) to authenticate
    the registration.

  On successful validation, a new patient ID is generated (starting from 1), and
  the patient’s data is stored. The mapping from wallet address to patient ID is
  also updated for quick lookups.

- **Updating patient status**:  
  Administrators can change the active status of a patient using the
  `updatePatientStatus` function, which also updates the patient’s last modified
  timestamp.

---

## 4. Provider registry

- **Provider data structure**:  
  The `Provider` struct contains:

  - The provider's name, license number, and type (e.g., "HOSPITAL", "CLINIC",
    "LAB").
  - Flags indicating if the provider is active or suspended.
  - Timestamps for when the provider was registered and last updated.

- **Provider registration and tracking**:  
  The `registerProvider` function allows an admin to add a new provider after:

  - Checking that the provider is not already registered.
  - Verifying the provider’s accreditation using a placeholder function.

  Once validated, the provider’s data is stored, the `PROVIDER_ROLE` is granted,
  and the provider’s address is added to a dedicated array
  (`_providerAddresses`). This array is later used to retrieve all provider
  addresses for operations like consent management.

- **Provider suspension**:  
  Administrators can suspend or reinstate a provider using the `suspendProvider`
  function, which updates the provider’s suspension status and last updated
  timestamp.

---

## 5. Consent management

- **Consent data structure**:  
  The `Consent` struct records:

  - The provider’s address for which consent is granted.
  - A flag indicating whether the consent is active.
  - Timestamps for when the consent was granted and, if applicable, when it was
    revoked.
  - The purpose for which consent is provided (e.g., "TREATMENT", "CLAIMS",
    "RESEARCH").

- **Granting and revoking consent**:
  - **Granting consent**:  
    Patients can call `grantConsent` to allow a provider to access their data
    for a specific purpose. This function checks that the provider exists and
    that consent has not been previously granted.
  - **Revoking consent**:  
    The `revokeConsent` function allows patients to withdraw consent, updating
    the consent status and recording the time of revocation.

---

## 6. Electronic health records (EHR) Management

- **EHR data structure**:  
  The `EHR` struct is used to store:

  - An IPFS hash that points to the off-chain location of the health record.
  - The provider’s address that is adding the record.
  - The document type (such as "PRESCRIPTION", "LAB_RESULT", or "IMAGE").
  - A timestamp of when the record was added.
  - A data hash for ensuring the integrity of the record.

- **Recording EHRs**:  
  The `addEHR` function enables an active provider (with valid consent from the
  patient) to add an EHR. The record is stored in an array associated with the
  patient’s address and an event is emitted to log this addition.

---

## 7. Insurance claims management

- **Insurance claim data structure**:  
  The `InsuranceClaim` struct encapsulates:

  - Addresses for both the patient and the provider.
  - The diagnosis code (which must adhere to ICD-10 length requirements).
  - The requested amount and the amount that gets approved.
  - A status field using an enum (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `DENIED`, `SETTLED`).
  - Timestamps for submission, approval, settlement, and denial.
  - A string to record the reason for denial.
  - An array to hold supporting EHR document references (e.g., IPFS hashes).

- **Claims workflow**:
  - **Submission**:  
    The `submitClaim` function lets a provider submit a claim on behalf of a
    patient (with proper consent). It validates the diagnosis code, accepts
    supporting EHRs, and logs the claim submission.
  - **Approval**:  
    Through the `approveClaim` function, an admin can approve a claim, ensuring
    the approved amount does not exceed the requested amount. The approval
    timestamp is recorded.
  - **Denial**:  
    The `denyClaim` function allows an admin to deny a claim, documenting the
    reason and timestamp for the denial.
  - **Settlement**:  
    The newly added `settleClaim` function permits an admin to mark an approved
    claim as settled, updating its status and recording the settlement
    timestamp.

---

## 8. Emergency controls

- **Pausing operations**:  
  The contract integrates a pausing mechanism using OpenZeppelin’s pausable
  module.

  - The `emergencyPause` function allows an admin to pause all contract
    operations, which is useful in a crisis or security incident.
  - The `emergencyUnpause` function restores normal operations.

  Both functions emit events to provide an audit trail of emergency actions.

## 9. View functions and private helpers

- **Retrieving patient consents**:  
  The `getPatientConsents` function gathers all active consents for a given
  patient by iterating through the tracked provider addresses. It compiles and
  returns an array of active consent records.

- **Private helper functions**:
  - `_providerExists`: Checks if a provider is registered by verifying the
    existence of a license number.
  - `_getAllProviders`: Returns the list of all registered provider addresses
    stored in `_providerAddresses`.
  - `_verifyGovernmentSignature` and `_verifyAccreditation`: These are stub
    functions that currently always return true; they serve as placeholders
    where robust external verification logic will be integrated.
