# Self-Hosted Installation Guide

Welcome to the SettleMint Platform self-hosted installation guide. This
comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying the SettleMint Platform in
your own infrastructure.

<Callout>
  **Installation Time** Complete installation typically takes 2-4 hours,
  depending on your infrastructure setup and familiarity with the components.
</Callout>

## Guide Structure

This installation guide is organized into three main sections. Select each tab
below to learn more:

<Tabs items={["1. Requirements", "2. Prerequisites", "3. Installation"]}>
  <Tab value="1. Requirements">
    ### Requirements Section

    Start here to ensure your infrastructure meets all necessary specifications before proceeding. This section covers:

    - Kubernetes cluster requirements
    - Network and storage specifications
    - Access and security requirements

  <Tab value="2. Prerequisites">
    ### Prerequisites Section

    After confirming requirements, set up the required supporting services. This section provides:

    - Step-by-step setup guides
    - Multiple deployment options
    - Configuration requirements
    - Information collection checklists

  <div>
    ### Required Access

    - Administrative access to your infrastructure
    - Ability to create/modify DNS records
    - Permission to deploy Kubernetes resources
    - Access to cloud resources (if applicable)

  </div>

  <div>
    ### Technical Prerequisites

    - Kubernetes cluster (1.20+)
    - `kubectl` CLI tool
    - `helm` (required for installation)
    - Basic understanding of container orchestration

  </div>

## Partner Support

A thorough understanding of Kubernetes concepts, architecture, and operation is
essential for successfully deploying and managing the SettleMint Platform. This
includes expertise in:

- Kubernetes cluster management
- Helm chart deployment and customization
- Infrastructure maintenance and monitoring
- Security best practices

If your team lacks the in-house expertise required for managing these
deployments, we strongly recommend collaborating with one of our certified
partners. Our partners are specifically trained to:

- Guide you through the installation process
- Help with infrastructure setup and configuration
- Provide ongoing maintenance and support
- Assist with troubleshooting and optimizations

Additionally, our blockchain technology experts are available to support you
with any technical questions or challenges you might encounter.

To connect with a certified partner or for direct assistance, please contact us
at support@settlemint.com.

## Information Collection

Throughout the installation process, you'll need to collect configuration
details from each prerequisite service. We've made this easy by including
"Information Collection Boxes" in each guide.

### How It Works

- Each prerequisite guide contains an Information Collection Box
- Required values are clearly marked
- Values are needed during platform installation
- Keep track of sensitive information securely

### Example Collection Box

Here's what an Information Collection Box looks like in the prerequisite guides:

<Callout type="info">
**Required Values Example**
This is a sample of what you'll see in the guides. For Redis setup, you would collect values like:

- Endpoint: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local
- Password: your-secure-password
- Port: 6379

Note: This is just an example. Actual values will be collected during the
prerequisite setup.
