## Enterprise deployment decision framework

Choosing the right deployment plan for enterprise blockchain workloads requires careful consideration of performance requirements, compliance needs, cost constraints, and organizational capabilities.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do I determine if my workload needs dedicated vs shared infrastructure?">
    Choose dedicated infrastructure for production workloads requiring guaranteed performance, compliance isolation, or predictable latency. Shared infrastructure works well for development, testing, and variable workloads where cost optimization is prioritized over guaranteed performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What factors affect total cost of ownership for different deployment plans?">
    TCO includes infrastructure costs, operational overhead, scaling requirements, data transfer costs, and compliance requirements. Dedicated plans have higher base costs but provide better predictability. Shared plans offer lower entry costs but may have variable performance and higher long-term costs for high-volume usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I plan for scaling from development to production workloads?">
    Start with shared infrastructure for development and proof-of-concept phases. Plan migration to dedicated infrastructure as workloads mature and require production-grade performance, security, and compliance capabilities.
  </Accordion>

For each service you deploy (network, node, smart contract set, etc.) you need
to select a deployment plan. The deployment plan defines the infrastructure
type, the cloud provider and region of your choice, and the resources (memory,
vCPU and disk space) that will be allocated to your service.

## Infrastructure type

Not all applications are equal. Some are for experimentation, some are pilots,
while others are high volume and mission critical. We make it easy to match the
infrastructure to the scale of the project.

- **Shared** - This is typically the most cost-effective deployment
  configuration. Resources are deployed in a shared cluster. The performance
  will vary based on the demand from other services sharing the infrastructure.
  This configuration is like living on an island with other inhabitants with
  whom you need to share limited resources.
- **Dedicated** - This configuration offers the highest specifications without
  requiring additional technical overhead. Your service runs on its own
  exclusively-used cloud infrastructure, meaning it can't be impacted by others.
  To continue the metaphor, with this configuration you choose the size of the
  island based on your needs, and you don't share its resources with anyone
  else.

**On-premise** and **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)** are also supported. Feel free
[contact us](mailto:support@settlemint.com) to discuss these options.

## Cloud provider and region

We offer you the flexibility to deploy your services in the cloud of your
choice, and easily build cross-cloud provider and cross-geographical region
networks. All leading cloud providers are supported and we are continously
working on adding support for more regions.

## Resource pack

The resource pack refers to the memory, vCPU and disk space allocated to your
service. You can choose between **small, medium and large**. If at some point
the current resource usage is about to reach its limit, and the service risks
getting stuck, you can scale the resource pack.

## Recommended setup

- Non-production application or Proof of Concept: shared infrastructure and
  small resource pack
- Application in production mode: dedicated infrastructure and medium resource
  pack
