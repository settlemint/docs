SettleMint can be deployed within an organizationâ€™s own air-gapped
infrastructure, providing enhanced security, data sovereignty, and compliance
with internal and regulatory requirements. Enterprises can build and manage
blockchain applications directly within their existing environments, including
Kubernetes and OpenShift, without reliance on external hosting or cloud
dependencies. This enables seamless deployment across multiple clusters and
regions, supporting highly distributed, hybrid blockchain architectures.

## Architecture at a glance

    network boundary while integrating with corporate identity providers, observability tooling, and downstream systems.

The diagram illustrates how administrators and developer teams authenticate through the organizationâ€™s identity provider,
manage projects via the SettleMint control plane, and operate blockchain nodes within clusters they control. Supporting
services such as logging, monitoring, key management, and enterprise line-of-business integrations remain within the same
security perimeter, ensuring regulatory compliance and operational consistency across environments.

Welcome to the SettleMint Platform self-hosted installation guide. This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying the SettleMint Platform in your own infrastructure for enterprises requiring maximum control, compliance, and security.

## When should enterprises choose self-hosted deployment?

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <Card>
    ### Data Sovereignty Requirements
    - Complete control over data location
    - Compliance with regional regulations (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)
    - Government and defense contractors
    - Financial services with strict data residency
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Security & Compliance Needs
    - Air-gapped network requirements
    - Zero external dependencies
    - Custom security policies
    - Internal audit and compliance frameworks
  </Card>
</div>

With centralized control through a unified dashboard, organizations can govern deployments across environments, assign role-based permissions, and enforce secure access policies. Integrated load balancing ensures high availability and scalability, while full ownership over hardware configurations allows teams to fine-tune compute, memory, and storage resources according to workload demands.

## Enterprise deployment benefits

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How does self-hosted deployment ensure data sovereignty?">
    Self-hosted SettleMint keeps all blockchain data, smart contracts, and user information within your infrastructure boundaries. This is crucial for organizations in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government, where data must remain within specific geographic boundaries or security perimeters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What compliance frameworks does self-hosted deployment support?">
    Our self-hosted solution supports major compliance frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. You maintain complete control over access logs, data encryption, and audit trails required for regulatory compliance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does self-hosted compare to SaaS in terms of total cost of ownership?">
    While self-hosted requires higher upfront infrastructure investment, it often provides better TCO for large enterprises through:
    - Predictable costs without per-user licensing
    - No data egress fees for high-volume operations
    - Ability to leverage existing infrastructure investments
    - Long-term cost control as usage scales
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What level of technical expertise is required for self-hosted deployment?">
    Self-hosted deployment requires Kubernetes administration expertise, including cluster management, monitoring, backup procedures, and security hardening. We recommend having certified Kubernetes administrators or partnering with our certified implementation partners.
  </Accordion>

## Information collection

Throughout the installation process, you'll need to collect configuration
details from each prerequisite service. We've made this easy by including
"Information Collection Boxes" in each guide.

### How it works

- Each prerequisite guide contains an Information Collection Box
- Required values are clearly marked
- Values are needed during platform installation
- Keep track of sensitive information securely

### Example collection box

Here's what an Information Collection Box looks like in the prerequisite guides:

<Callout type="info">
**Required Values Example**

This is a sample of what you'll see in the guides. For Redis setup, you would
collect values like:

- Endpoint: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local
- Password: your-secure-password
- Port: 6379

Note: This is just an example. Actual values will be collected during the
prerequisite setup.
