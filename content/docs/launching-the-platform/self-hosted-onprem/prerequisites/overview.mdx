Before installing the SettleMint Platform in enterprise environments, you'll need to set up several core services with enterprise-grade security, high availability, and compliance capabilities. This guide will walk you through each prerequisite and help you collect the necessary information for production installation.

## Enterprise architecture considerations

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <Card>
    ### High Availability Requirements
    - Database clustering and failover
    - Redis cluster or sentinel setup
    - Load balancer redundancy
    - Multi-zone deployments
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Security & Compliance
    - SSL/TLS encryption for all services
    - Network segmentation and firewalls
    - Audit logging and monitoring
    - Secret management and key rotation
  </Card>
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  Use the sidebar to navigate between different prerequisites. We recommend
  following them in order, but you can skip to specific sections if needed.
</Callout>

## How to use this section

1. Review each prerequisite service
2. Choose your preferred deployment method for each service
3. Follow the setup instructions
4. Record the required information in a secure location
5. Proceed to the next prerequisite

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to complete **all** prerequisites before proceeding with the
  platform installation. Missing or incorrectly configured services can cause
  installation failures.
</Callout>
