Navigate to [SettleMint](https://console.settlemint.com/) and follow these steps
to create an account:

1. Choose to sign up with **Google**, **Github**, **Auth0** or with a **magic
   link**. Magic links let you sign up and log in without a password. When you
   provide your email address, you get a magic link sent to your email. Once you
   click on the link, you will be logged in.

2. Enter your **first and last name**, and choose a name for your
   **organization**. An organization is the highest level of hierarchy in
   SettleMint. It's at this level that you create and manage blockchain
   applications, invite team members to collaborate, and manage billing. You can
   create as many organizations as you want. Choose a name that is easily
   recognizable in your dashboards (like your company name, department name,
   team name, etc.). You can change the name of your organization at any time.

3. Choose a name for your first **blockchain application**. You may want to
   choose a name related to what you are building, e.g. track and trace, NFT,
   data exchange, etc. Names like "my first app" or "test app" are also fine.
   You can change the name of an application at any time.
