## Overview

When launching a blockchain development project, you need to decide where your
project will be stored. SettleMint offers you the flexibility to deploy in the
cloud of your choice, and easily build cross-cloud provider and
cross-geographical region networks.

Every deployment uses Kubernetes as an orchestration layer for all the different
services. Kubernetes is a widely used open-source system for automating the
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. By leveraging
managed Kubernetes services by cloud providers, our platform can offer
affordable, stable, and scalable environments to run the blockchain nodes and
additional services.
