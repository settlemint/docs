description: Overview of the SettleMint CLI
---

The SettleMint CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a robust tool crafted to enhance
interaction with the SettleMint blockchain platform directly from your terminal.
It enables developers, administrators, and blockchain enthusiasts to efficiently
manage blockchain networks, deploy smart contracts, and configure infrastructure
without relying on a graphical interface. Designed for versatility, the CLI
supports integration with popular package managers like npm, Yarn, Bun, and
pnpm, offering both local and global installation options, as well as automation
capabilities through GitHub Actions.

## Core Functionality

The **SettleMint CLI (`@settlemint/sdk-cli`)** is a command-line interface
designed to simplify blockchain development and infrastructure management. It
enables developers to:

**Manage blockchain projects**  
**Deploy and test smart contracts**  
**Configure infrastructure and nodes**  
**Generate TypeScript code for dApp development**

The CLI supports **multiple package managers** (npm, Yarn, Bun, pnpm) and
**integrates with GitHub Actions**, providing automation for CI/CD workflows.

> **TIP:** To verify installation, run `settlemint --version` after setup.
