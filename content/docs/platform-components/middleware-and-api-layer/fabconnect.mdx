description: Firefly fabconnect for Hyperledger Fabric Networks
---

FireFly FabConnect is a **Fabric middleware** that provides an API layer for
interacting with **Hyperledger Fabric networks**. It abstracts the complexities
of Fabricâ€™s native SDKs, enabling developers to interact with the blockchain
using **RESTful APIs** and **WebSocket-based event streaming**. FireFly
FabConnect is designed to handle **identity management, transaction submission,
and event subscriptions**, making it an essential component for enterprise
blockchain solutions.

### Adding FabConnect Middleware in SettleMint

1. **Navigate to Middleware Selection**

   - Go to the **Middleware** section in SettleMint.
   - Select **FireFly FabConnect** from the available options.

2. **Select Network and Nodes**
   - **Step 1:** Enter a name for the middleware instance (e.g., `FabConnect`).
   - **Step 2:** Choose a **peer node** from the available **Hyperledger
     Fabric** nodes.
   - **Step 3:** Select an **orderer node** to process transactions.
   - **Step 4:** Confirm the setup and deploy FabConnect.

Once selected, SettleMint automatically installs and configures FireFly
FabConnect, making it ready for use with minimal effort.

## API Categories

FireFly FabConnect provides three main sets of API endpoints:

1. **Client MSPs (Wallet)**

   - Register and enroll Fabric identities.
   - Modify and revoke existing identities.
   - Retrieve identity details.

2. **Transactions**

   - Submit transactions to Fabric networks.
   - Query transaction results and receipts.
   - Retrieve ledger details, such as blocks and chain information.

3. **Events**
   - Subscribe to blockchain events using regex-based filters.
   - Stream real-time events via WebSocket.

Below is a summary of the available API endpoints:

## Prerequisites

To use FireFly FabConnect within SettleMint, ensure:

- A **Hyperledger Fabric Network** is deployed and accessible.
- Fabric **peer and orderer nodes** are available for selection.
- API credentials for Fabric CA (if identity management is required).

Since FireFly FabConnect is managed within SettleMint, there is no need to
manually install or configure the service.

---

## Integration & Usage

Once FireFly FabConnect is set up in SettleMint:

1. **API Access**

   - Use the provided **RESTful API endpoints** to interact with the Fabric
     network.
   - Query blockchain data, submit transactions, and manage identities.

2. **Event Subscriptions**

   - Set up WebSocket or webhook-based event listeners.
   - Receive real-time updates on transactions and smart contract events.

3. **Identity Management**
   - Register new Fabric identities.
   - Enroll and revoke identities as needed.

The API simplifies interaction with the Fabric network, making blockchain
integration seamless.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Nodes Not Available?** Ensure your Fabric network is running with active
  peer and orderer nodes.
- **Transaction Errors?** Check the transaction payload format and ensure it
  matches the Fabric chaincode specifications.
- **Event Subscription Issues?** Validate the WebSocket connection and event
  filters.

For further support, refer to FireFly FabConnect's official documentation.
