Middleware acts as a bridge between your blockchain network and applications,
providing essential services like data indexing, API access, and event
monitoring. Before adding middleware, ensure you have an application and
blockchain node in place.

## How to Add Middleware

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    <Steps>
      ### Navigate to Application
      Navigate to the **application** where you want to add middleware.

      ### Access Middleware Section
      Click **Middleware** in the left navigation, and then click **Add a middleware**. This opens a form.

      ### Configure Middleware
      1. Choose middleware type (Graph or Portal)
      2. Choose a **Middleware name**
      3. Select the **blockchain node**
      4. Configure deployment settings
      5. Click **Confirm**
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First ensure you're authenticated:
    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    Create a middleware:
    ```bash
    # Get the list of available middleware types
    settlemint platform create middleware --help

    # Create a middleware
    settlemint platform create middleware <type> <name>

    # Get information about the command and all available options
    settlemint platform create middleware <type> --help
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    import { createSettleMintClient } from '@settlemint/sdk-js';

    const client = createSettleMintClient({
      accessToken: 'your_access_token',
      instance: 'https://console.settlemint.com'
    });

    // Create middleware
    const createMiddleware = async () => {
      const result = await client.middleware.create({
        applicationUniqueName: "your-app-unique-name",
        name: "my-middleware",
        type: "SHARED",
        interface: "GRAPH",
        blockchainNodeUniqueName: "your-node-unique-name",
        region: "EUROPE",  // Required
        provider: "GKE",   // Required
        size: "SMALL"      // Valid options: "SMALL" | "MEDIUM" | "LARGE"
      });
      console.log('Middleware created:', result);
    };
    ```

## Manage Middleware

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to your middleware and click **Manage middleware** to:
    - View middleware details and status
    - Update configurations
    - Monitor health
    - Access endpoints
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List middlewares
    settlemint platform list middlewares --application <app-name>

    # Get middleware details
    settlemint platform read middleware <middleware-name>

    # Delete middleware
    settlemint platform delete middleware <middleware-name>
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    ```typescript
    // List middlewares
    await client.middleware.list("your-app");

    // Get middleware details
    await client.middleware.read("middleware-unique-name");

    // Delete middleware
    await client.middleware.delete("middleware-unique-name");
    ```

  </Tab>

## The Graph Middleware

The Graph provides powerful indexing capabilities for EVM chains through
subgraphs. Use this middleware when you need:

- Custom indexing logic through subgraph manifests
- Complex GraphQL queries
- Real-time data updates

### Using The Graph SDK

```typescript
import { createTheGraphClient } from "@settlemint/sdk-thegraph";

const { client: graphClient, graphql } = createTheGraphClient({
  instances: JSON.parse(
    process.env.SETTLEMINT_THEGRAPH_SUBGRAPHS_ENDPOINTS || "[]"
  ),
  accessToken: process.env.SETTLEMINT_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
  subgraphName: "your-subgraph",
});
```

<Callout type="tip">
  For detailed API reference and advanced usage examples, check out the
  [TheGraph SDK
  documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/thegraph).
</Callout>

### Using The Graph Middleware

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) is a protocol for indexing and querying
blockchain data from networks. It can be used with all EVM-compatible chains
like Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu, Polygon, Avalanche, etc. You can run it on your
own blockchain nodes (both public and permissioned).

Using the Graph protocol, you can create **subgraphs** that define which
blockchain data will be indexed. The middleware will then use these subgraphs to
correctly index your smart contracts and expose a developer-friendly and
efficient **GraphQL API**, allowing you to query the data you need.

We have some prebuilt subgraph indexing modules included in the smart contract
set, and you can build your own modules if you have a custom smart contract set.

<Callout type="warning">
  Before you start, make sure you are running an EVM-compatible network
  (Ethereum, Polygon, Hyperledger Besu, Avalanche, etc.)
</Callout>

When the middleware is deployed, follow these steps to start using it:

### Define and deploy a subgraph

Navigate to the **smart contract set** which you want to index, go the
**details** and open the **IDE**. Here you will define the subgraph to set the
indexing specifications, and deploy it so it can be loaded into the middleware.
There are instructions included in the IDE to help you.

#### Subgraph raw configuration

Inside the root you will find a file called `subgraph.config.json` that contains
the raw configuration of the subgraph. The important section is the
**datasources** section.

- **Name** - here we defined the smart contracts with their name (the name of
  the artifact created in the 'deployments' folder when running the deploy task)
- **Address & Startblock** - You will notice the startblock and address to be 0.
  You must fill these in when your contract has been deployed. The block number
  and the address can be found in the **deployment** folder, under **ignition**.
- **Module** - In the modules array all the indexing modules to activate for
  this smart contract.

#### About the indexing modules

We provide **two libraries** of indexing modules: one by the **OpenZeppelin**
team for all the common smart contracts in their smart contract library, and one
by the **SettleMint** team to extend the capabilities of the OpenZeppelin one,
and to provide indexing of the specific SettleMint smart contract sets.

The OpenZeppelin set contains the following indexing modules:

- accesscontrol
- erc1155
- erc1967upgrade
- erc20
- erc721
- governor
- ownable
- pausable
- timelock
- voting

The SettleMint set contains the following indexing modules:

- erc721ipfs: to extend the ERC-721 from OpenZeppelin to index IPFS metadata of
  your ERC-721 tokens
- crowdsale/vestingvault/vestingwallet: to index and expose all the data for the
  crowdsale contract set
- forwarder: for the ERC-20 Meta transactions forwarder data
- statemachinemetadata: to index IPFS metadata for state machines

These are available in the `subgraph` folder in your IDE. You can create your
own modules for any other data you want to index, or for custom smart contracts
not part of the default sets. And you can modify the existing ones if you want
to index things a bit different.

#### Write your own indexing module

You can also write your own custom indexing module for smart contracts that are
not part of the default sets.

Follow these steps to create a custom indexing module:

- Primitives to generate a GraphQL schema: `subgraph/datasource/x.gql.json` - In
  order to allow composability, the schema are not defined in the GraphQL format
  but rather in a dedicated JSON format which is can be assembled and compiled
  to GraphQL.
- Template to generate a subgraph manifest: `subgraph/datasource/x.yaml` - This
  file lists all the events that the datasources should listen to, and links
  that to the corresponding indexing logic.
- Indexing logic: `subgraph/datasources/x.ts` and (optionally)
  `subgraph/fetch/x.ts` - This is the core logic that processes the events to
  index the onchain activity.

[To learn more, check it out on Github.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-subgraphs)

#### Start your subgraph

The following tasks need to be run in this sequence:

- `btp-scs subgraph codegen` - Generates the AssemblyScript types for your
  contracts ABI.
- `btp-scs subgraph build` - Compiles the WASM files based on the outputs
  generated by `btp-scs subgraph codegen`.
- `btp-scs subgraph deploy` - Deploys the WASM files to IPFS and updates the
  middleware to start or update the indexing.

The indexing of your smart contracts has now started. This can take a while, but
once done you can query the middleware for your data in seconds using the
**GraphQL API**. You can find the **endpoint** in the **Connect-tab**.
