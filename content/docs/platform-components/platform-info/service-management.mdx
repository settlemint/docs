# Service Management

SettleMint provides comprehensive service management capabilities designed for production-grade blockchain operations. These features enable DevOps teams and platform administrators to efficiently manage, monitor, and maintain services across their blockchain infrastructure.

## Overview

The Service Management suite in SettleMint offers:

- **Granular service control** with pause/resume capabilities
- **Dependency tracking** for safe operations
- **Batch operations** for efficient management
- **Auto-retry mechanisms** for resilient operations
- **Service restart procedures** with minimal disruption

These capabilities are essential for maintaining high availability and reliability in enterprise blockchain deployments.

## Core Features

### Pause/Resume Services

The pause/resume functionality allows administrators to temporarily halt services without terminating them, preserving state and configuration while reducing resource consumption.

#### When to Use Service Pausing

- **Maintenance windows**: Pause non-critical services during infrastructure updates
- **Resource optimization**: Temporarily pause development or staging services
- **Cost management**: Pause services during off-hours to reduce cloud costs
- **Debugging**: Isolate services for troubleshooting

#### Pausing a Service

```bash
# Via SettleMint CLI
settlemint service pause <service-id>

# Via Platform UI
1. Navigate to Services dashboard
2. Select the service
3. Click "Pause Service" button
4. Confirm the action
```

#### Resuming a Service

```bash
# Via SettleMint CLI
settlemint service resume <service-id>

# Via Platform UI
1. Navigate to Services dashboard
2. Select the paused service
3. Click "Resume Service" button
```

### Service Dependencies Tracking

SettleMint automatically tracks service dependencies to ensure safe operations and prevent cascading failures.

#### Dependency Types

1. **Hard Dependencies**: Services that must be running
   - Blockchain nodes for middleware services
   - Database services for application backends
   - Storage services for IPFS gateways

2. **Soft Dependencies**: Services that enhance functionality
   - Monitoring services
   - Caching layers
   - Load balancers

#### Viewing Dependencies

```bash
# CLI command to view dependencies
settlemint service dependencies <service-id>

# Example output:
Service: graph-middleware-prod
├── Hard Dependencies:
│   ├── ethereum-node-1 (RUNNING)
│   └── postgres-db-1 (RUNNING)
└── Soft Dependencies:
    ├── redis-cache-1 (RUNNING)
    └── monitoring-agent (PAUSED)
```

### Dependants Tree Visualization

The dependants tree provides a visual representation of which services rely on a particular service, enabling impact analysis before maintenance operations.

#### Understanding the Dependants Tree

```
ethereum-node-1
├── graph-middleware-prod
│   ├── api-gateway-1
│   └── api-gateway-2
├── smart-contract-portal
└── transaction-signer
    └── dapp-frontend
```

This visualization helps:
- **Impact assessment**: Understand which services will be affected
- **Maintenance planning**: Schedule downtime appropriately
- **Risk mitigation**: Identify critical paths in your infrastructure

#### Accessing Dependants Tree

Via the Platform UI:
1. Navigate to the service details page
2. Click on "View Dependants" tab
3. Explore the interactive tree visualization

Via CLI:
```bash
settlemint service dependants <service-id> --tree
```

### Batch Operations

Batch operations enable efficient management of multiple services simultaneously, crucial for large-scale deployments.

#### Available Batch Operations

1. **Batch Pause/Resume**
   ```bash
   # Pause multiple services
   settlemint service pause --batch service1,service2,service3
   
   # Resume all paused services in an application
   settlemint service resume --app <app-id> --all-paused
   ```

2. **Batch Restart**
   ```bash
   # Restart all services matching a pattern
   settlemint service restart --pattern "api-*"
   ```

3. **Delete All Services**
   
   ⚠️ **Warning**: This is a destructive operation. Use with extreme caution.
   
   ```bash
   # Delete all services in a specific environment
   settlemint service delete-all --env staging --confirm
   
   # With safety checks
   settlemint service delete-all --env staging --dry-run
   ```

#### Batch Operation Best Practices

1. **Always perform dry runs** before executing batch operations
2. **Use filters** to target specific service groups
3. **Monitor logs** during batch operations
4. **Have rollback plans** ready

### Auto-retry on Failure

SettleMint's auto-retry mechanism ensures service resilience by automatically attempting to recover from transient failures.

#### Configuration Options

```yaml
# service-config.yaml
autoRetry:
  enabled: true
  maxAttempts: 3
  backoffStrategy: exponential
  initialDelay: 30s
  maxDelay: 5m
  retryableErrors:
    - CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
    - RESOURCE_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE
    - RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
```

#### Retry Strategies

1. **Fixed Delay**: Retry after a constant interval
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retries
3. **Jittered Backoff**: Randomized delays to prevent thundering herd

#### Monitoring Auto-retry

```bash
# View retry statistics
settlemint service retry-stats <service-id>

# Example output:
Service: blockchain-indexer
Total Retries: 12
Success Rate: 91.7%
Average Recovery Time: 2m 34s
Last Retry: 2024-01-15 10:23:45 UTC
```

### Service Restart Procedures

Proper service restart procedures ensure minimal disruption and data integrity.

#### Standard Restart Procedure

1. **Pre-restart checks**
   ```bash
   settlemint service health-check <service-id>
   settlemint service dependencies <service-id>
   ```

2. **Graceful restart**
   ```bash
   settlemint service restart <service-id> --graceful --timeout 300
   ```

3. **Post-restart validation**
   ```bash
   settlemint service validate <service-id>
   ```

#### Rolling Restart for High Availability

For services with multiple instances:

```bash
# Perform rolling restart with 30s delay between instances
settlemint service rolling-restart <service-id> \
  --delay 30s \
  --health-check-interval 10s \
  --max-unavailable 1
```

## Production-Grade Best Practices

### 1. Service Lifecycle Management

- **Development**: Liberal use of pause/resume for cost optimization
- **Staging**: Test all maintenance procedures before production
- **Production**: Use rolling restarts and maintenance windows

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting

Set up comprehensive monitoring:

```yaml
# monitoring-config.yaml
alerts:
  - name: service-restart-frequency
    condition: restart_count > 5 in 1h
    severity: warning
    
  - name: dependency-failure
    condition: hard_dependency_down > 0
    severity: critical
    
  - name: batch-operation-failure
    condition: batch_success_rate < 0.95
    severity: error
```

### 3. Maintenance Windows

Plan maintenance windows with dependency awareness:

```bash
# Generate maintenance plan
settlemint maintenance plan \
  --services ethereum-node-1,graph-middleware \
  --window "2024-01-20 02:00-04:00 UTC" \
  --impact-analysis
```

### 4. Disaster Recovery

Implement service recovery procedures:

```bash
# Backup service configurations
settlemint service backup --all --dest s3://backup-bucket/services/

# Restore services from backup
settlemint service restore --from s3://backup-bucket/services/latest/
```

## Use Cases and Examples

### Use Case 1: Scheduled Maintenance

**Scenario**: Upgrading blockchain node software with zero downtime

```bash
# 1. Deploy new version alongside existing
settlemint service deploy ethereum-node-2 --version 2.0

# 2. Sync new node
settlemint service wait-for-sync ethereum-node-2

# 3. Update load balancer
settlemint lb update --add ethereum-node-2 --weight 10

# 4. Gradually shift traffic
for weight in 25 50 75 100; do
  settlemint lb update --service ethereum-node-2 --weight $weight
  sleep 300
  settlemint service health-check ethereum-node-2
done

# 5. Pause and remove old node
settlemint service pause ethereum-node-1
settlemint service delete ethereum-node-1 --after 24h
```

### Use Case 2: Cost Optimization

**Scenario**: Pausing non-production services during off-hours

```bash
# Create a scheduled job
cat > pause-dev-services.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
# Pause all development services at 8 PM
settlemint service pause --env development --all

# Resume at 8 AM (separate cron job)
EOF

# Add to crontab
0 20 * * * /path/to/pause-dev-services.sh
```

### Use Case 3: Emergency Response

**Scenario**: Rapid response to security incident

```bash
# 1. Isolate affected services
settlemint service pause --tag affected-services --immediate

# 2. Analyze dependencies
settlemint service dependants --tag affected-services --export affected-deps.json

# 3. Apply security patches
settlemint service update --tag affected-services --image security-patched:latest

# 4. Gradual service restoration
settlemint service resume --tag affected-services --staged --delay 5m
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Service fails to pause**
   - Check for active transactions
   - Verify no critical operations in progress
   - Review service logs for errors

2. **Dependency conflicts**
   - Use `--force` flag with caution
   - Update dependency configurations
   - Consider service decoupling

3. **Batch operation partial failure**
   - Review operation logs
   - Retry failed services individually
   - Adjust timeout and retry settings

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Detailed service state
settlemint service debug <service-id>

# Dependency resolution trace
settlemint service deps --trace <service-id>

# Event history
settlemint service events <service-id> --last 50
```
