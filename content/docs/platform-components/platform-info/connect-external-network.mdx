title: "Besu - External network"
---

The SettleMint platform seamlessly integrates with existing external networks.
You can deploy nodes on your external network within the SettleMint platform,
enabling you to leverage the platform's robust features, including monitoring,
resource scaling, an intuitive JSON-RPC UI, and reliable uptime management.

## Prerequisites

- A Hyperledger Besu or Quorum OBFT network
- The genesis file of the network
- At least one enode URL of an existing running node on the network (required to
  sync the platform node with the existing network)

## Joining a Network

1. Navigate to the create network form (see
   [how to do this here](/building-with-settlemint/evm-chains-guide/add-network-and-nodes)).
2. Select **Join permissioned network**.
3. Choose **Hyperledger Besu** or **Quorum** depending on the network you want
   to join.
4. Enter names for the network and the node.
5. Upload the network's genesis file. Bootnodes specified in the genesis file
   will be automatically identified and added as external nodes.
6. Add at least one enode URL of an existing running node on the network. Note:
   If a bootnode is specified in the genesis file, it will be added
   automatically as an external node, allowing you to skip this step.
7. Choose the deployment plan for the node. For more information about
   deployment plans,
   [see here](/launching-the-platform/managed-cloud-saas/deployment-plans).

This process will create a new non-validator node in your existing network.

## Adding Nodes

To add more nodes to your network:

1. Navigate to the create node form.
2. Choose between creating the node as a validator or non-validator.
3. Note: To deploy nodes as validators, a majority (66%) of validators must be
   running on the SettleMint platform.
4. If you don't have a majority, create the node as a non-validator first, then
   follow the process in [Add a Validator](#add-a-validator) to make it a
   validator.

Once a majority of validators are running on the platform, deploying new nodes
as validators becomes possible without voting on external validators. We
recommend having a majority of validators running on the platform for seamless
addition and removal of validators from the network.

## Add a Validator

Unless a majority of validators are running on the platform, you need to send
votes on the externally running validators to add the platform node as a
validator.

Execute the following on all your validator nodes:

- For Hyperledger Besu:
  [qbft_proposeValidatorVote](https://besu.hyperledger.org/stable/private-networks/reference/api#qbft_proposevalidatorvote)
- For Quorum:
  [istanbul_propose](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.io/reference/api-methods#istanbul_propose)

Find the enode URL of the platform node in the 'Details' tab of the node under
the 'Node Identity' section. Once the vote is reflected in the network, restart
the node in the platform. The node will be added as a validator and will start
proposing blocks.

## Remove a Validator

To make a platform validator a non-validator, execute the following on every
validator node:

- For Hyperledger Besu:
  [qbft_proposeValidatorVote](https://besu.hyperledger.org/stable/private-networks/reference/api#qbft_proposevalidatorvote)
  with proposal "false"
- For Quorum:
  [istanbul_propose](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.io/reference/api-methods#istanbul_propose)
  with proposal "false"

Once the vote is reflected in the network, restart the node in the platform. The
node will be removed as a validator and will stop proposing blocks.

## Node Type Conflict Warning

The platform displays a node type conflict warning when there's a discrepancy
between the node type in the platform and the node type on the network.

This can occur when:

- The node is added as a non-validator on the platform but runs as a validator
  on the network.
- The node is added as a validator on the platform but runs as a non-validator
  on the network.

To resolve this, you can either:

1. Update the node type in the platform to match the node type on the network,
   or
2. Add or remove the node as a validator on the network using the steps
   mentioned above.

The platform will automatically resolve the node type conflict warning shortly
after the necessary changes are made.

## Migrating existing networks to SettleMint platform

Migrating an existing Hyperledger Besu or Quorum (using OBFT or IBFT2 consensus)
network to the SettleMint platform enables organizations to move from
self-managed infrastructure to a robust, cloud-native blockchain operations
environment. The platform provides an intuitive and secure environment for node
management, validator orchestration, and real-time monitoring while ensuring
compatibility with existing private networks. This process begins with ensuring
that a few key prerequisites are in place: access to the current network’s
genesis file, at least one `enode://` address of an active node for
synchronization, and the contract ABIs and addresses of any deployed smart
contracts.

## Joining the existing network

To initiate the migration, the organization will log into the SettleMint
platform and navigate to the "Create Network" form. From there, they will choose
the "Join permissioned network" option and select either Hyperledger Besu or
Quorum as the client, depending on their existing setup. They will assign a name
to the network and the joining node and then upload the `genesis.json` file. If
the genesis file includes bootnodes, the platform automatically identifies and
configures these as external peers. If not, at least one enode address must be
manually added. The organization will then choose a deployment plan based on
performance requirements, and SettleMint will spin up a non-validator node that
connects to the external network.

## Syncing data and smart contracts

Once the node joins the network, it will begin full synchronization using the
Ethereum protocol. This includes downloading block headers, transaction bodies,
receipts, and reconstructing the entire state trie up to the current block. This
process ensures that all smart contracts deployed on the existing network are
immediately accessible from the SettleMint node without requiring redeployment.
The platform uses standard syncing algorithms such as snap sync or full sync to
ensure the node reconstructs the full world state, including account balances,
contract bytecode, and storage variables. As a result, all transaction history,
event logs, and deployed contract states will be visible and accessible via the
SettleMint platform’s JSON-RPC explorer or API endpoints.

## Migrating validators

To migrate validator nodes, organizations can use SettleMint to deploy
additional nodes and vote them in as validators from the currently running
validator nodes. This involves retrieving the enode of the SettleMint node from
the platform’s dashboard and issuing a validator proposal on each legacy
validator node. For Besu networks, this is done using the
`qbft_proposeValidatorVote` RPC method, while for Quorum, it involves calling
`istanbul_propose`. Once the validator vote is reflected in the consensus state,
the platform node must be restarted. This process can be repeated for each node
until a majority (66% or more) of the validators are hosted on SettleMint. At
that point, further changes to validator sets can be handled exclusively within
the platform, streamlining validator governance.

## Dismantling external infrastructure

After all SettleMint nodes are synced and operating correctly, and once
validator roles have been transitioned, the organization may proceed to
decommission their old infrastructure. This includes shutting down legacy
non-validator nodes and removing any remaining external validators by proposing
removal votes (`qbft_proposeValidatorVote` or `istanbul_propose` with `false`).
It is also important to update all dependent applications—dApps, API services,
and frontends—to point to the new SettleMint-managed JSON-RPC or HTTP endpoints.

## Using SettleMint platform features

Following the migration, the organization will gain access to the full suite of
SettleMint platform tools. These include live node health dashboards, block
explorers, logs, a contract management interface, metrics and alerts via Grafana
and Prometheus, and scalable infrastructure for increasing throughput and fault
tolerance. In the event of a node type conflict—where a node’s role (validator
or non-validator) differs between the network and platform—the platform will
flag this discrepancy and guide the user to either update the node type in the
platform or modify the node’s role on the network. Once the correction is made
and the node is restarted, the conflict will automatically resolve.
<br></br>

The migration process is designed to be non-disruptive and reversible until the
point of final infrastructure decommissioning. The platform allows organizations
to run SettleMint nodes alongside their existing infrastructure, enabling a
phased and secure migration path that aligns with operational and governance
policies.
