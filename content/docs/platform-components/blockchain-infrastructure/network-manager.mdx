| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain ID            | A unique identifier for the blockchain network.                 |
| Seconds per Block   | Time interval for block creation.                               |
| Gas Price           | Minimum gas price required for transactions (specified in wei). |
| Gas Limit           | Maximum amount of gas allowed per block.                        |
| EVM Stack Size      | Maximum stack size for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).      |
| Contract Size Limit | Maximum size of a smart contract in kilobytes (KB).             |

#### Genesis block configuration

The `genesis.json` file is a critical component of EVM-based blockchain
networks, defining the initial state and parameters of the blockchain to ensure
secure and structured network operations. Key elements include:

- **Chain ID**: Uniquely identifies the network to prevent replay attacks.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Determines how blocks are validated, providing the
  necessary governance structure (e.g. QBFT, PoA, PoS).
- **Pre-allocated Balances**: Specify the initial allocation of tokens for
  specific addresses.
- **QBFT Validator Information**: Defines the nodes responsible for validating
  transactions in Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)-based networks.

#### Developer integrations

The SettleMint Network Manager provides developer-friendly tools to facilitate
smart contract development and network interactions:

- **Faucet Wallets**: Enable test token distribution for private networks,
  making it easier for developers to test transactions.
- **Genesis file availability**: Users can access and download `genesis.json`
  file, allowing for easy network expansion outside SettleMint platform.

### Hyperledger fabric networks

![Fabric Network Config](../../../img/platfrom-components/fabric-config.png)

#### Channel configuration and policies

Hyperledger Fabric networks use a `configtx.json` file to define network
channels, membership rules, and policies. Key components include:

- **Application Group**: Defines policies for participating organizations,
  specifying details such as:
  - **Organization Name**
  - **Policies**:
    - **Admin**: Roles allow users to modify configurations.
    - **Endorsement**: Policies require transaction approvals from specific
      peers.
    - **Readers and Writers**: Policies define access to channel data.
- **Orderer Group**: Configures the ordering service responsible for transaction
  finalization. Settings include:
  - **Batch Timeout**: Determines the time before transactions are grouped into
    a block.
  - **Max Messages Per Batch**: Controls block size.
- **Consensus Type**: Typically `etcdraft`, a Raft-based ordering service.

#### Network governance and security

Hyperledger Fabric networks require robust security and governance mechanisms:

- **Membership Service Provider (MSP)**: Controls identity verification and
  authentication, ensuring only authorized participants can access the network.
- **Root Certificates and TLS Certificates**: Define trusted entities for secure
  communication.
- **Endorsement Policies**: Determine how transactions are validated across
  organizations, enforcing compliance and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Block Validation Policies**: Ensure the integrity and security of the
  distributed ledger, maintaining network trustworthiness.
