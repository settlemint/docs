# Blockscout Explorer for EVM Chains

Blockscout is an open-source blockchain explorer optimized for Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM)-compatible networks. It provides a comprehensive interface for
querying and analyzing blockchain data, including transactions, blocks, token
transfers, addresses, and smart contracts. Designed for real-time visibility,
Blockscout delivers structured access to on-chain operations, serving as a
critical tool for developers, auditors, and system architects. Its extensible
architecture and detailed data presentation facilitate both high-level
monitoring and granular inspection of EVM-based ecosystems.

Transactions refer to standard on-chain actions initiated by externally owned
accounts (EOAs), like sending tokens, deploying contracts, or interacting with
smart contracts. These are recorded directly on the blockchain with their own
transaction hash.
![Trasnactions](../../../img/platfrom-components/blockscout-transactions.png)

Internal Transactions (also called “message calls”) are operations triggered
within smart contracts, often as a result of a transaction. For example, a
contract calling another contract or transferring ETH/token internally. These
are not standalone transactions but are captured through execution traces and
don’t appear directly on-chain.
![Internal Transactions](../../../img/platfrom-components/blockscout-internal-transactions.png)

It enables precise interrogation of blockchain state through its block and
transaction monitoring capabilities. Blocks are indexed by unique hashes or
sequential numbers, exposing attributes such as block height, timestamp, gas
consumption, and transaction volume. Transaction data includes sender and
recipient addresses, transferred values, gas costs, and execution status (e.g.,
success, failure, pending). For smart contract interactions, Blockscout parses
input data to extract function calls and parameters, providing developers with
actionable insights for debugging and validation workflows. The explorer
supports detailed address inspection for both externally owned accounts (EOAs)
and smart contracts. Queryable data encompasses current balances, transaction
histories, and token associations. For verified smart contracts, Blockscout
exposes source code and Application Binary Interface (ABI), enabling direct
interaction via the platform. This functionality supports use cases such as
wallet tracking, address investigation, and contract deployment verification,
making it an indispensable resource for EVM developers and security analysts.

## API Overview

Blockscout provides multiple API interfaces to interact with blockchain data,
including REST API, JSON RPC & ETH Compatible RPC Endpoints, and GraphQL. These
APIs are designed for ease of use, supporting developers transitioning from
other explorers like Etherscan to Blockscout, as well as those requiring general
API and data support.

## GraphQL in Blockscout

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data,
making it easier to access and use. It acts like a librarian for blockchain
data, organizing it for quick retrieval. It decentralizes the reading layer,
ensuring reliability and security by avoiding single points of failure.
Subgraphs are custom databases within The Graph that define how to collect,
organize, and store data from blockchain smart contracts. They make data
queryable via GraphQL, simplifying access to complex information like NFT
transfer histories. Blockscout integrates with The Graph to enhance its data
querying capabilities. Subgraphs can be created to index data from EVM chains
supported by Blockscout, such as Ethereum or Sepolia. Once deployed to The
Graph's network, which includes over 450 indexers worldwide, this data can be
queried efficiently using GraphQL. This integration allows developers to combine
Blockscout's detailed blockchain exploration with The Graph's powerful indexing
and querying, enabling more advanced dApp development.

### What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a
runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It provides an efficient,
powerful, and flexible approach to developing web APIs. It allows clients to
define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the
data is returned from the server, preventing excessively large amounts of data
from being returned.

#### Key Concepts of GraphQL

- **Hierarchical:** Queries are structured hierarchically, allowing nested data
  retrieval.
- **Strongly Typed:** Schemas define types for all data, ensuring predictable
  responses.
- **Client-Specified Queries:** Clients can request exactly the data they need,
  reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.

#### Advantages of GraphQL

- **Declarative Integration on Client:** Clients specify what data/operations
  they need.
- **Standard Way to Expose Data and Operations:** Provides a consistent API
  structure.
- **Support for Real-Time Data:** Enables real-time updates with subscriptions.

### Query Types

There are three main query types in a GraphQL schema:

1. **Query:** Fetch data, such as retrieving posts or transactions.
2. **Mutation:** Change data, such as updating a post or modifying a record.
3. **Subscription:** Subscribe to real-time data, such as new posts in a
   category.

### Access GraphQL API

To access Blockscout's GraphQL interface, use **GraphiQL**, an in-browser IDE
for exploring GraphQL, which is built into Blockscout. From the APIs dropdown
menu, choose GraphQL. Alternatively, you can use your favorite HTTP client to
send requests to the GraphQL endpoint.

#### GraphiQL Interface

The GraphiQL interface provides a user-friendly environment to explore and test
GraphQL queries. It includes a documentation explorer (Docs section) that
provides schema details, such as root types, and a query editor to write and
execute queries.

### Queries

Blockscout's GraphQL API provides queries and a subscription, viewable in the
GraphQL interface under the Docs menu. Example queries include:

```graphql
address(hash: AddressHash!): Address           # Gets an address by hash
addresses(hashes: [AddressHash!]): [Address]   # Gets addresses by hashes
block(number: Int!): Block                     # Gets a block by number
transaction(hash: FullHash!): Transaction      # Gets a transaction by hash
```

#### Example Query to Retrieve Transactions for a Specific Address

```graphql
{
  address(hash: "0xaddressHash") {
    transactions(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          blockNumber
          createdContractAddressHash
          fromAddressHash
          gas
          hash
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
