A **blockchain node** is a **computer program** that maintains and verifies the
integrity of a distributed ledger. A **set of nodes** forms a **network**,
ensuring decentralized operations by synchronizing blockchain data and executing
transactions. Nodes collectively validate and store information, making
blockchains secure, transparent, and immutable.

**EVM-based blockchains** support both **public** and **permissioned** networks.
**Public EVM blockchains**, such as **Ethereum and Polygon**, are open to
anyone, allowing decentralized participation in transaction validation and smart
contract execution. These networks rely on economic incentives and
permissionless consensus mechanisms like **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to maintain
security and decentralization. On the other hand, **permissioned EVM
blockchains**, such as **Quorum and Hyperledger Besu**, restrict participation
to authorized entities. These networks prioritize privacy, regulatory
compliance, and efficiency, often using **Proof of Authority (PoA)** or **Quorum
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)** to validate transactions. Whether public or
permissioned, all EVM-based blockchains rely on a distributed set of nodes to
maintain state synchronization and network security.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a **permissioned blockchain framework** built for
enterprises requiring secure, controlled, and scalable blockchain solutions.
Unlike EVM-based blockchains, which may be **public or permissioned**, Fabric
networks are exclusively **permissioned**, ensuring that only pre-approved
entities can operate nodes, validate transactions, and access network data.
Fabricâ€™s modular architecture allows organizations to define governance models,
identity management policies, and consensus mechanisms tailored to their
specific needs. Transactions in Fabric are endorsed by selected peers and then
ordered into blocks using mechanisms like **Raft** or **Byzantine Fault Tolerant
(BFT) ordering**, prioritizing efficiency and compliance over decentralization.

---

### **Types of nodes in evm-based blockchains**

- **Validator Nodes:** Actively participate in consensus by proposing and
  finalizing new blocks. These nodes maintain ledger integrity by operating
  under consensus mechanisms like **Proof of Authority (PoA)** or **Istanbul
  Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT)**.
- **Non-Validator Nodes (Observer Nodes):** Do not take part in consensus but
  instead **synchronize blockchain data, respond to queries, and facilitate
  smart contract execution**. They maintain updated copies of the blockchain
  without finalizing blocks.

### **Among non-validator nodes:**

- **Full Nodes:** Store the entire blockchain history and verify transactions
  without participating in block finalization.
- **Archive Nodes:** Extend full node functionality by retaining complete
  historical blockchain states, making them essential for querying past
  transactions.

### **Core components of an evm-based node**

- **Execution Layer (EVM):** Processes smart contracts and updates the
  blockchain state.
- **Networking Layer (devp2p Protocol):** Facilitates peer-to-peer communication
  for efficient data propagation.
- **Storage Layer:** Manages blockchain data, including account states, logs,
  receipts, and the **Merkle Patricia Trie** for world-state management.
- **JSON-RPC Interface:** Provides an API for dApps, wallets, and external
  applications to interact with the blockchain.

---

### **Types of nodes in hyperledger fabric**

- **Peer Nodes:** Maintain the ledger and execute smart contracts
  (**Chaincode**).
  - **Endorsing Peers:** Simulate transactions and provide endorsement
    signatures, ensuring compliance with business rules.
  - **Committing Peers:** Validate endorsed transactions and update the ledger.
- **Ordering Nodes (Orderers):** Handle transaction sequencing, package
  transactions into blocks, and distribute them to peers. These nodes ensure
  consensus across the network using mechanisms like **Raft** or **Byzantine
  Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering**.
- **Certificate Authority (CA) Nodes:** Issue and authenticate identities using
  **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**, enforcing security policies and access
  controls.

Unlike EVM-based blockchains, Fabric nodes **do not store a global state in
shared memory**. Instead, they use separate **key-value stores and dedicated
ledgers**, enhancing **privacy and scalability**.

## **Certificate authorities**

Certificate Authorities play a key role in the network because they dispense
X.509 certificates that can be used to identify components as belonging to an
organization. Certificates issued by CAs can also be used to sign transactions
to indicate that an organization endorses the transaction result - a
precondition of it being accepted onto the ledger. Let's examine these two
aspects of a CA in a little more detail.

Firstly, different components of the blockchain network use certificates to
identify themselves to each other as being from a particular organization. CAs
are so important that Hyperledger Fabric provides you with a built-in one
(called the Fabric-CA) to help you get going.

The mapping of certificates to member organizations is achieved via a structure
called a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines an organization by
creating an MSP which is tied to a root CA certificate to identify that
components and identities were created by the root CA.

The mapping of certificates to member organizations is achieved via a structure
called a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines an organization by
creating an MSP which is tied to a root CA certificate to identify that
components and identities were created by the root CA. The channel configuration
can then assign certain rights and permissions to the organization through a
policy.

Secondly, certificates issued by CAs are at the heart of the transaction
generation and validation process. Specifically, X.509 certificates are used in
client application transaction proposals and smart contract transaction
responses to digitally sign transactions. Subsequently the network nodes who
host copies of the ledger verify that transaction signatures are valid before
accepting transactions onto the ledger.

More information about the Fabric-CA can be found on the official Hyperledger
Fabric-CA documentation website.

## **Identities**

The different actors in a blockchain network include peers, orderers, client
applications, administrators and more. Each of these actors , active elements
inside or outside a network able to consume services , has a digital identity
encapsulated in an X.509 digital certificate. These identities really matter
because they determine the exact permissions over resources and access to
information that actors have in a blockchain network.

A digital identity furthermore has some additional attributes that Fabric uses
to determine permissions, and it gives the union of an identity and the
associated attributes a special name , principal. Principals are just like
userIDs or groupIDs, but a little more flexible because they can include a wide
range of properties of an actor's identity, such as the actor's organization,
organizational unit, role or even the actor's specific identity. When we talk
about principals, they are the properties which determine their permissions.

For an identity to be verifiable, it must come from a trusted authority. A
membership service provider (MSP) is that trusted authority in Fabric. More
specifically, an MSP is a component that defines the rules that govern the valid
identities for this organization. The default MSP implementation in Fabric uses
X.509 certificates as identities, adopting a traditional Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) hierarchical model.

More information about identities can be found on the official Hyperledger
Fabric documentation website.

SettleMint's platform uses the Fabric-CA to create a root CA, this CA acts as a
dual-headed CA, meaning that it is used for issuing MSP and TLS certificates.
This CA must be used to issue all certificates for the network, orderers, peers,
administrators, and client applications.

## **Peers**

Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and
chaincode (which contain smart contracts) and are therefore one of the physical
points at which organizations that transact on a channel connect to the channel
(the other being an application). A peer can belong to as many channels as an
organizations deems appropriate (depending on factors like the processing
limitations of the peer pod and data residency rules that exist in a particular
country).

More information about peers can be found on the official Hyperledger Fabric
documentation website.

## **Orderers**

An orderer (also known as an "ordering node") does transaction ordering, which
along with other orderer nodes forms an ordering service. Because Fabric's
design relies on deterministic consensus algorithms, any block validated by the
peer is guaranteed to be final and correct. Orderers also enforce basic access
control for channels, restricting who can read and write data to them, and who
can configure them.

The ordering service gathers endorsed transactions from applications and orders
them into transaction blocks, which are subsequently distributed to every peer
node in the channel. At each of these committing peers, transactions are
recorded and the local copy of the ledger updated appropriately. An ordering
service is unique to a particular channel, with the nodes servicing that channel
also known as a "consenter set". Even if a node (or group of nodes) services
multiple channels, each channel's ordering service is considered to be a
distinct instance of the ordering service.

More information about orderers and the ordering service can be found on the
official Hyperledger Fabric documentation website.

Application channels, or simply channels SettleMint's platform creates by
default an application channel called "default-channel" which is used to create
an initial ledger for the network.

Users can create additional application channels using the binaries provided by
Hyperledger Fabric (install them locally and download the node's certificates)
or by creating a Smart contract set which is a configured web IDE with all the
necessary files and binaries to interact with your peer node and orderers.

### **Core components of a hyperledger fabric node**

- **Chaincode Layer:** Executes smart contract logic and enforces business
  rules.
- **Ledger Layer:** Stores transactional data using **LevelDB** or **CouchDB**
  as key-value state databases.
- **Communication Layer:** Manages gRPC-based interactions between nodes.
- **Membership Service Provider (MSP):** Governs identity verification, access
  policies, and network governance.

## **Settlemint platformâ€™s node manager**

![Nodes List](../../../img/platfrom-components/node-list.png)

The **SettleMint Node Manager** simplifies blockchain node deployment and
management, offering a **user-friendly interface** to configure, monitor, and
maintain nodes on different blockchain networks. It enables businesses and
developers to:

- **Deploy nodes in a few clicks** without complex configurations.
- **Monitor network health and performance** with real-time statistics.
- **Pause and resume nodes** to optimize resource usage and costs.
- **Interact with blockchain APIs** through JSON-RPC, WebSockets, and GraphQL.
- **Manage security and identity credentials** via cryptographic key management.

## Node types on SettleMint platform

For Ethereum, SettleMint provides support for the Geth client. This means that
when you add an Ethereum node, you get a Geth node by default. All nodes running
in SettleMint are configured to be archive nodes, meaning they all include all
previous states of a given blockchain since its origin.

For hyperledger besu, SettleMint provides the option between Validator and
Non-validator nodes. All nodes are configured to be archive nodes.

For hypelerledger fabric, SettleMint offers options between peer and orderer
nodes.

## 1. Hyperledger Besu node overview

The **Besu Node Dashboard** serves as a comprehensive interface for managing and
monitoring a **Hyperledger Besu node**. It provides insights into node status,
network connectivity, blockchain interactions, and system performance.

## Consensus mechanisms

A consensus mechanism defines the rules for the nodes in a blockchain network to
reach an agreement on the current state of the blockchain ledger.

Besu comes with several consensus mechanisms. As an Ethereum implementation,
Proof of Work (PoW) is a given, but the **Proof of Authority (PoA)** options are
more suitable for enterprise projects. These can be used when participants know
each other and there is a level of trust between them, e.g. in a permissioned
consortium network.

PoA is a light and practical consensus mechanism that gives a small and
designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions within
the network and to create new blocks. This results in faster block times and a
much greater transaction throughput.

**SettleMint's Enterprise Ethereum networks always use QBFT**

### IBFT v2 (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance v2)

IBFT v2 is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm designed for private Ethereum networks. It provides immediate finality and is well-suited for consortium networks where validators are known and trusted.

#### Key Characteristics of IBFT v2:

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Can tolerate up to (n-1)/3 faulty nodes, where n is the total number of validators
- **Immediate Finality**: Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be reverted
- **Deterministic Block Creation**: Validators take turns proposing blocks in a round-robin fashion
- **No Forks**: The consensus mechanism prevents chain forks
- **Fixed Block Times**: Blocks are produced at regular intervals

#### How IBFT v2 Works:

1. **Validator Selection**: A fixed set of validators is defined in the genesis file or can be added/removed through voting
2. **Block Proposal**: In each round, one validator is selected as the proposer based on a deterministic algorithm
3. **Prepare Phase**: The proposer broadcasts a proposed block to all validators
4. **Commit Phase**: Validators exchange prepare and commit messages
5. **Block Finalization**: When 2/3+ validators agree, the block is finalized and added to the chain

#### IBFT v2 Configuration Example:

```json
{
  "genesis": {
    "config": {
      "chainId": 1337,
      "ibft2": {
        "blockperiodseconds": 2,
        "epochlength": 30000,
        "requesttimeoutseconds": 10
      }
    },
    "extraData": "0x[encoded validator addresses]"
  }
}
```

### QBFT (Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

QBFT is an enhanced version of IBFT v2, offering improved performance and additional features for enterprise use cases. It maintains the core BFT properties while adding optimizations for production environments.

#### Key Advantages of QBFT over IBFT v2:

- **Better Performance**: Optimized message passing reduces latency
- **Enhanced Liveness**: Improved round change mechanism prevents network stalls
- **Validator Reputation**: Tracks validator performance for better proposer selection
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested in enterprise deployments
- **Backward Compatible**: Easy migration from IBFT v2

#### QBFT-Specific Features:

1. **Optimized Message Flow**: Reduces the number of messages exchanged between validators
2. **Adaptive Timeout**: Dynamic timeout adjustment based on network conditions
3. **Enhanced Validator Management**: More flexible validator set changes
4. **Better Metrics**: Detailed consensus metrics for monitoring

#### QBFT Configuration Example:

```json
{
  "genesis": {
    "config": {
      "chainId": 1337,
      "qbft": {
        "blockperiodseconds": 5,
        "epochlength": 30000,
        "requesttimeoutseconds": 10,
        "validatorcontractaddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000007777"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Differences Between IBFT v2 and QBFT

| Feature | IBFT v2 | QBFT |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Message Complexity** | Higher message overhead | Optimized message passing |
| **Round Change** | Basic timeout mechanism | Adaptive timeout with better liveness |
| **Validator Selection** | Simple round-robin | Reputation-based selection available |
| **Production Maturity** | Stable but older | Enhanced for production use |
| **Migration Path** | - | Easy migration from IBFT v2 |
| **Monitoring** | Basic metrics | Comprehensive consensus metrics |
| **Performance** | Good for small networks | Better for larger validator sets |

### Use Cases for Each Consensus Mechanism

#### When to Use IBFT v2:
- Small consortium networks (< 10 validators)
- Proof of concept implementations
- Networks requiring simple, predictable behavior
- Legacy systems already using IBFT v2

#### When to Use QBFT:
- Production enterprise networks
- Larger validator sets (10+ validators)
- Networks requiring high throughput
- Systems needing detailed monitoring
- New deployments on SettleMint platform

### Performance Characteristics

#### IBFT v2 Performance:
- **Block Time**: Typically 1-5 seconds
- **Throughput**: ~100-400 TPS depending on configuration
- **Latency**: 2-3 seconds for finality
- **Network Size**: Optimal for 4-10 validators

#### QBFT Performance:
- **Block Time**: Can be configured from 1-10 seconds
- **Throughput**: ~400-1000 TPS with optimizations
- **Latency**: 1-2 seconds for finality
- **Network Size**: Efficient up to 30+ validators

### Security Considerations

Both IBFT v2 and QBFT provide:
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Resistant to malicious nodes
- **Immediate Finality**: No risk of chain reorganization
- **Permissioned Access**: Only authorized validators can participate
- **Cryptographic Security**: All messages are signed

When you deploy a Hyperledger Besu blockchain network on SettleMint, it uses QBFT by default for optimal performance and reliability in enterprise environments.

More information on Hyperledger Besu can be found in the official
[Hyperledger Besu documentation](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).

### 1.2 Connect with node

![EVM Node Connection](../../../img/platfrom-components/evm-node-connection.png)

This tab provides the **API endpoints** to interact with the node via different
protocols:

- **JSON-RPC Endpoint** â€“ Used for blockchain interactions and queries.
- **WebSocket (JSON-WS) Endpoint** â€“ Enables real-time event streaming.
- **GraphQL Endpoint** â€“ Allows structured data querying.

For a software application to interact with a blockchain (e.g. by sending
transactions/data to the network, or even just by reading data), it must connect
to a node.

This section describes how to connect to your Besu node.

## Backend APIs

Once a node has been deployed on an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible
network, it can be accessed by different endpoints such as JSON-RPC, JSON-WS or
GraphQL. You can connect to your already deployed node using these 3 most common
endpoints.

### JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC, is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.
Primarily, the specification defines several data structures and the rules
around their processing. By default, the version of the JSON-RPC protocol needs
to be 2.0, and you need to provide the node ID as well as a method and
parameters.

There are different kinds of methods that can be used: ADMIN methods, DEBUG
methods, ETH methods etc. The entire list of methods that can be used can be
found in the [Besu official documentation](https://besu.hyperledger.org).

If you want to correctly connect to your node, you need to respect the right
structure for the request, which is always the same:

```json
{
"jsonrpc":"2.0"
"Id": nodeId
"method":"methodName"
"params":{
}
}
```

If you want to connect to a node deployed on the SettleMint platform, go to the
**Connect** tab on the **Node detail page** in the **Blockchain nodes** section
of your application. Select JSON-RPC or any other endpoint and click **Try it
out**. You will then be redirected to a new tab where you will be able to test
different methods as well as the related Curl command line.

### JSON-WS

To make RPC requests over WebSockets, you can use wscat, which is by definition
a Node.js based command-line tool. First you will need to connect to your node's
WebSocket server using wscat, as follows:
`"wscat -c ws://<JSON-RPC-ws-endpoint:port>"` . All the credentials are provided
in the **Connect** tab on the **Node detail page** in the **Blockchain nodes**
section of your application. After you have established a connection, the
terminal should display a ">" prompt. You will then be able to send individual
requests as a JSON data package, as above, for instance:

```json
{
"jsonrpc":"2.0"
"Id": 1
"method":"eth_blockNumber"
"params":{
}
}
```

### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for API's. It is designed to
make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. We have a GraphQL interface
that can be used with many different queries. These queries can be tested out in
our GraphQL playground. You can also test out the different graphql queries with
cURL, those request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-auth-token: <AUTH_TOKEN>" --data
'{ "query": "{syncing{startingBlock currentBlock highestBlock}}"}' http://<DOMAIN>.settlemint.com/graphql
```

If you want to connect to a node deployed on the SettleMint platform, go to the
**Connect** tab on the **Node detail page** in the **Blockchain nodes section**
of your application. Select Graphql and click **Try it out**. This will bring
you to the GraphQL playground where you can use all the different queries.

## Javascript API

If you do not want to use the above endpoints to connect to your node, it is
possible to use plain Javascript. Several convenience libraries exist within the
different ecosystem which makes connection much easier. With these libraries,
developers around the world can write one-line methods to easily initiate
requests (still under the hood) that interact with Ethereum or any other EVM
compliant network. Note that some libraries might be available for Ethereum but
not for the other networks.

These libraries are very helpful and abstract away much of the complexity of
interacting directly with your node. Most also provide useful and
straightforward functions such as converting ETH to Gwei, so that you can spend
less time dealing with decimal issues and more time on the functionality of your
underlying application.

One of the most commonly used libraries, Ethers, is extremely easy to use for
signing transactions, sending tokens etc. For example:

```typescript
// If you don't specify a //url//, Ethers connects to the default
// (i.e. ``http:/\/localhost:8545``)
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();

// The provider also allows signing transactions to
// send ether and pay to change state within the blockchain.
// For this, we need the account signer...
const signer = provider.getSigner();
```

## Node connections

For an application to interact with a blockchain (e.g. by sending
transactions/data to the network, or even just by reading data), it must connect
to a node.

To connect to a node, you use an endpoint, which is a URL that enables an API to
gain access to the node. You interact with the node by sending requests to, and
receiving responses from it via an API.

You can find the endpoints on the node detail page, in the Connect tab, together
with node interaction tools with playgrounds for real-time tryouts (e.g.
JSON-RPC, GraphQL, etc.).
