A **blockchain node** is a **computer program** that maintains and verifies the
integrity of a distributed ledger. A **set of nodes** forms a **network**,
ensuring decentralized operations by synchronizing blockchain data and executing
transactions. Nodes collectively validate and store information, making
blockchains secure, transparent, and immutable.

**EVM-based blockchains** support both **public** and **permissioned** networks.
**Public EVM blockchains**, such as **Ethereum and Polygon**, are open to
anyone, allowing decentralized participation in transaction validation and smart
contract execution. These networks rely on economic incentives and
permissionless consensus mechanisms like **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to maintain
security and decentralization. On the other hand, **permissioned EVM
blockchains**, such as **Quorum and Hyperledger Besu**, restrict participation
to authorized entities. These networks prioritize privacy, regulatory
compliance, and efficiency, often using **Proof of Authority (PoA)** or
**Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)** to validate transactions. Whether
public or permissioned, all EVM-based blockchains rely on a distributed set of
nodes to maintain state synchronization and network security.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a **permissioned blockchain framework** built for
enterprises requiring secure, controlled, and scalable blockchain solutions.
Unlike EVM-based blockchains, which may be **public or permissioned**, Fabric
networks are exclusively **permissioned**, ensuring that only pre-approved
entities can operate nodes, validate transactions, and access network data.
Fabric’s modular architecture allows organizations to define governance models,
identity management policies, and consensus mechanisms tailored to their
specific needs. Transactions in Fabric are endorsed by selected peers and then
ordered into blocks using mechanisms like **Raft** or **Byzantine Fault Tolerant
(BFT) ordering**, prioritizing efficiency and compliance over decentralization.

### **Types of Nodes in EVM-Based Blockchains**

- **Validator Nodes:** Actively participate in consensus by proposing and
  finalizing new blocks. These nodes maintain ledger integrity by operating
  under consensus mechanisms like **Proof of Authority (PoA)** or **Istanbul
  Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT)**.
- **Non-Validator Nodes (Observer Nodes):** Do not take part in consensus but
  instead **synchronize blockchain data, respond to queries, and facilitate
  smart contract execution**. They maintain updated copies of the blockchain
  without finalizing blocks.

### **Among non-validator nodes:**

- **Full Nodes:** Store the entire blockchain history and verify transactions
  without participating in block finalization.
- **Archive Nodes:** Extend full node functionality by retaining complete
  historical blockchain states, making them essential for querying past
  transactions.

### **Core Components of an EVM-Based Node**

- **Execution Layer (EVM):** Processes smart contracts and updates the
  blockchain state.
- **Networking Layer (devp2p Protocol):** Facilitates peer-to-peer communication
  for efficient data propagation.
- **Storage Layer:** Manages blockchain data, including account states, logs,
  receipts, and the **Merkle Patricia Trie** for world-state management.
- **JSON-RPC Interface:** Provides an API for dApps, wallets, and external
  applications to interact with the blockchain.

---

### **Types of Nodes in Hyperledger Fabric**

- **Peer Nodes:** Maintain the ledger and execute smart contracts
  (**Chaincode**).
  - **Endorsing Peers:** Simulate transactions and provide endorsement
    signatures, ensuring compliance with business rules.
  - **Committing Peers:** Validate endorsed transactions and update the ledger.
- **Ordering Nodes (Orderers):** Handle transaction sequencing, package
  transactions into blocks, and distribute them to peers. These nodes ensure
  consensus across the network using mechanisms like **Raft** or **Byzantine
  Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering**.
- **Certificate Authority (CA) Nodes:** Issue and authenticate identities using
  **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**, enforcing security policies and access
  controls.

Unlike EVM-based blockchains, Fabric nodes **do not store a global state in
shared memory**. Instead, they use separate **key-value stores and dedicated
ledgers**, enhancing **privacy and scalability**.

### **Core Components of a Hyperledger Fabric Node**

- **Chaincode Layer:** Executes smart contract logic and enforces business
  rules.
- **Ledger Layer:** Stores transactional data using **LevelDB** or **CouchDB**
  as key-value state databases.
- **Communication Layer:** Manages gRPC-based interactions between nodes.
- **Membership Service Provider (MSP):** Governs identity verification, access
  policies, and network governance.

## Node Connections

For an application to interact with a blockchain (e.g. by sending
transactions/data to the network, or even just by reading data), it must connect
to a node.

To connect to a node, you use an endpoint, which is a URL that enables an API to
gain access to the node. You interact with the node by sending requests to, and
receiving responses from it via an API.

You can find the endpoints on the node detail page, in the Connect tab, together
with node interaction tools with playgrounds for real-time tryouts (e.g.
JSON-RPC, GraphQL, etc.).
