# Cost Estimation

SettleMint's Cost Estimation feature is a powerful budget planning tool that helps organizations predict and optimize their blockchain infrastructure costs before deployment. This comprehensive tool provides accurate cost projections, resource usage predictions, and optimization recommendations to ensure cost-effective blockchain operations.

## Overview

The Cost Estimation feature enables you to:

- **Predict costs** before deploying blockchain infrastructure
- **Analyze resource requirements** for different configurations
- **Compare pricing** across different deployment plans
- **Optimize configurations** for cost efficiency
- **Plan budgets** with confidence
- **Track estimated vs actual costs** post-deployment

## Pre-deployment Cost Estimation

### Accessing the Cost Estimator

1. Navigate to your organization's dashboard
2. Click on **Billing** in the sidebar
3. Select **Cost Estimator** tab
4. Choose your deployment type (Managed Cloud or Self-Hosted)

### Configuration Options

The cost estimator allows you to configure:

- **Network Type**: Public (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) or Private (Besu, Fabric)
- **Node Configuration**: Number of nodes, node size, and performance tier
- **Storage Requirements**: Data retention period and expected transaction volume
- **Middleware Services**: Graph indexing, API gateways, monitoring tools
- **High Availability**: Multi-region deployment and redundancy options

## Resource Usage Predictions

### Transaction Volume Estimation

The cost estimator helps predict resource usage based on:

```
Daily Transactions × Average Transaction Size × Retention Period = Storage Requirements
```

#### Example Calculation

For a DeFi application expecting:
- 10,000 daily transactions
- 250 bytes average transaction size
- 2-year retention period

```
Storage = 10,000 × 250 bytes × 730 days = 1.825 GB
Monthly Storage Cost = 1.825 GB × $0.10/GB = $0.18
```

### Node Performance Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Tier">
    **Suitable for**: Development and testing environments
    - 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM
    - Up to 100 transactions/second

    - 8+ vCPUs, 32GB+ RAM
    - 1000+ transactions/second
    - Multi-region deployment
    - **Estimated Cost**: $1000+/month per node
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Architecture Optimization

1. **Right-sizing nodes**
   - Start with smaller nodes and scale up based on actual usage
   - Use auto-scaling for variable workloads
   - Consider shared nodes for development environments

2. **Storage optimization**
   - Implement data archiving strategies
   - Use IPFS for large file storage instead of on-chain storage
   - Configure appropriate retention policies

3. **Network optimization**
   - Use regional deployments to minimize data transfer costs
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize API calls to reduce bandwidth usage

### Cost-Saving Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development">
    - Use shared infrastructure for multiple dev environments
    - Implement automated shutdown for non-business hours
    - Leverage spot instances where available
    - **Potential Savings**: 40-60%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Staging">
    - Mirror production at 50% capacity
    - Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
    - Share middleware services across environments
    - **Potential Savings**: 30-40%
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Production">
    - Commit to annual pricing for 20-30% discount
    - Implement intelligent auto-scaling
    - Use multi-year reserved instances
    - **Potential Savings**: 20-35%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using the Cost Estimation Tools

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define Your Requirements**
   ```yaml
   application:
     type: "DeFi Protocol"
     expected_users: 10000
     daily_transactions: 50000
     data_retention: "2 years"
     availability: "99.9%"
   ```

2. **Select Infrastructure Components**
   - Choose blockchain network(s)
   - Configure node specifications
   - Add required middleware services
   - Set storage requirements

3. **Review Cost Breakdown**
   - Monthly and annual projections
   - Cost per transaction estimates
   - Comparison with industry benchmarks

4. **Apply Optimizations**
   - Review recommended configurations
   - Adjust based on budget constraints
   - Balance performance vs cost

### Cost Estimation API

For programmatic access to cost estimates:

```javascript
const estimate = await settlemint.billing.estimateCosts({
  network: 'ethereum',
  nodes: {
    count: 3,
    tier: 'standard',
    region: 'us-east-1'
  },
  storage: {
    blockchain: 500, // GB
    ipfs: 1000 // GB
  },
  services: ['graph-node', 'monitoring', 'api-portal']
});

console.log(`Monthly estimate: $${estimate.monthly}`);
console.log(`Annual estimate: $${estimate.annual}`);
console.log(`Cost per transaction: $${estimate.perTransaction}`);
```

## Budget Planning Best Practices

### 1. Start with Conservative Estimates

Always plan for 20-30% higher usage than initial projections to account for:
- Unexpected growth
- Development overhead
- Testing and staging environments

### 2. Implement Cost Monitoring

Set up alerts and monitoring for:
- Budget threshold warnings (75%, 90%, 100%)
- Unusual usage spikes
- Inefficient resource utilization

### 3. Regular Cost Reviews

Schedule monthly reviews to:
- Compare estimated vs actual costs
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Adjust configurations based on usage patterns

### 4. Plan for Scaling

Consider future growth scenarios:
- 2x current load: What infrastructure changes are needed?
- 10x current load: When to consider architecture changes?
- Geographic expansion: Multi-region deployment costs
