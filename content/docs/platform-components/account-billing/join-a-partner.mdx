## Understanding the Client-Partner Model


As a client of a SettleMint Partner, you can transfer your organization to a
partner's organization.

Other clients that have been transferred to this partner **WILL NOT** have
access to any of your organization's information.

## What changes after joining a partner?

### Organization Access

After joining a partner, all users that are in the partner's organization on
SettleMint will now have access to manage your applications. This includes any
sensitive information attached to them.

### Resource Usage Cost

Depending on your configuration, the resource usage costs of your organization
(ex: Blockchain Networks/Nodes) can be hidden. In this case, these costs are now
managed by the partner's organization.

### Billing

Depending on your configuration, the invoicing for your resource usage can
either be handled by the partner or directly with SettleMint. If handled by the
partner, the billing changes will take effect in the same billing cycle when the
transfer is made.

### Resource Cost Monitoring

The cost of resources your organization uses on SettleMint (ex: Blockchain
Networks/Nodes) will no longer be shown. This will be handled by the partner.

## How to join a partner

1. **Open Organizations & Apps**

   By going to the hompage and selecting the organization dashboard, then the
   manage menu of the organization , you will see the option to
   `Join a partner`. By clicking on this you will be shown the `Join a partner`
   form to complete.

<Callout type="info">

The `Join a Partner` option is only available to users with administrative
access to your organization.

2. **Add the Partner Email**

   On this form, it is required that you enter a `Partner Contact email`. This
   email is the email of a contact person at the partner that you are joining.

3. **Confirmation**

   After completing the form, the partner will receive a transfer code via the
   email you entered. They will then use this transfer code to add your
   organization as [a client](/account-billing/add-a-client).

   Once completed, you will see a note for 24 hours in the SettleMint platform
   that your organization has been transfered.
