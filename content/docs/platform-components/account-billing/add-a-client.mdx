## Understanding the Partner-Client Model 

As a SettleMint partner, you can manage your client's resource usage and
applications on the platform.  This is done by transfering your client's
organization to your organization.

Your organization's other clients **WILL NOT** see information from any other
clients.

Clients already using SettleMint can request to link their organization to
yours. The client selects [join a partner](/account-billing/join-a-partner) from
their account to start the process.

## Enabling Partner Access

To enable your organization to have partner access on SettleMint, you must first
contact the SettleMint customer success team at support@settlemint.com to
request access. We will confirm your request and do the needed configuration
steps.

## What changes after becoming a partner?

### Manage Client Apps

### Organization Access

After joining a partner, all users of your organization will now have access to
the client's applications. You are now able to manage their resources and
applications (ex: Blockchain Networks / Nodes).

After setting up your organization as a partner on SettleMint, you will now have
the ability to manage to your client's applications and resource usage.

On the SettleMint dashboard your organization's applications will now be labeled
as `Internal applications`. The `Clients & apps` section on the homepage
displays your client's applications.

### Manage Client Invoicing

Clients can be configured to either receive invoices directly from SettleMint or
through your organization.

### Manage Client Pricing

Clients can be configured to either see the pricing of their resource usage or
have these hidden.

Your organization's other clients **WILL NOT** see information from any other
clients.

### Resource Cost Monitoring

Your client will not see the cost of their resources used on SettleMint (ex:
Blockchain Nodes). This information is only shared with you.

### Billing

The client will no longer receive any invoices or billing directly from
SettleMint. They will receive one last invoice from SettleMint to close out the
current billing period.

## How To Add a Client

### Clients already using SettleMint

Clients already using SettleMint can request to transfer their organization to
yours. The client selects [join a partner](/account-billing/join-a-partner) from
their account to start the process.

### Client new to SettleMint

Clients new to SettleMint can get access to organizations you have created for
them. The client receives an invite from an administrator after being
[added as a new client](#how-to-add-a-client) and inviting them as members.

1. **Open Organizations & Apps**

If your account has been enabled as a partner, you will find both a `Clients`
list and an `Add a client` option under the `Organization & Apps` menu. Clicking
on `Organization Menu` (4 squares) in the top right opens this menu.

:::info The `Add Client` option is only available to users with administrative
access to the organization.  :::

2. **Add the Client Name or Transfer Code**

For clients new to SettleMint, you can create a new organization for them by
entering a client name.

For clients already using SettleMint, you can transfer their organization by
selecting the transfer code option. The tranfer code is what you received by
email when a client has requested to
[join a partner](/account-billing/join-a-partner).

3. **Confirming Client Added**

For clients new to SettleMint, you will be redirected to the client's SettleMint
Dashboard. You can begin to
[create applications](/platfrom-components/create-an-application) and
[invite members to your client's organization](/launching-the-platform/managed-cloud-deployment/about-organizations).

Clients already using SettleMint will receive an email confirming the transfer
of the client's organization. You will see their organization shown under the
`Clients & apps` list on the main dashboard.
