## Enterprise Token Creation Process

<Callout type="success" title="Secure Token Generation">
**Enterprise Security**: SettleMint's token creation process implements industry-standard security practices with automated encryption, audit logging, and compliance controls for production environments.
</Callout>

### Access Token Management

Navigate to your application dashboard and access **App Access Tokens** from the enterprise navigation panel to begin creating production-ready authentication tokens.

<Steps>

### Initialize Token Creation
Click **"Add an application access token"** to open the enterprise token configuration form with advanced security options.

### Configure Token Parameters
- **Token Name**: Assign a descriptive identifier for enterprise tracking and management
- **Expiration Policy**: Set strategic expiration dates based on security policies (non-modifiable after creation)
- **Scope Configuration**: Choose between comprehensive or granular access control

### Define Access Scope
<Tabs defaultValue="all">
<Tab value="all" label="All Services">

**Comprehensive Access Strategy**
- Grants access to all current and future application services
- Automatic service inclusion for seamless scaling
- Ideal for enterprise automation and system integration
- Reduces administrative overhead for dynamic environments

</Tab>
<Tab value="specific" label="Specific Services">

**Granular Security Control**
- Selective service access for zero-trust architecture
- Precise scope definition for compliance requirements
- Enhanced security through least-privilege access
- Flexible scope updates for changing business needs

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Finalize Token Creation
Click **Confirm** to generate your enterprise-grade application access token with cryptographic security and audit trail integration.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Enterprise Security Protocol">
**Critical**: Immediately copy and securely store your token using enterprise password management systems. This token provides application-level access and cannot be retrieved after creation.
</Callout>

## Enterprise Token Management

### Token Scope Updates

<Callout type="tip" title="Zero-Downtime Updates">
**Operational Continuity**: Scope modifications are applied immediately without service interruption, enabling dynamic security adjustments for evolving business requirements.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Access Token Management Interface
Navigate to your target application and select **App Access Tokens** to view all enterprise authentication tokens.

### Review Current Configuration
Click **View Scopes** for your target token to examine current access permissions and service configurations.

### Apply Scope Modifications
Select **Update** to modify token permissions, enabling granular control over service access for enhanced security posture.

### Validate Configuration Changes
Review and **Confirm** your updated scope configuration to ensure alignment with enterprise security policies.

</Steps>

### Enterprise Token Revocation

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Incident Response">
**Immediate Action**: For compromised tokens or discontinued integrations, implement immediate revocation to prevent unauthorized access to enterprise services.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Access Security Management
Navigate to the application dashboard containing the compromised or unused token.

### Locate Target Token
Access **App Access Tokens** to view all active authentication tokens for enterprise review.

### Execute Secure Deletion
Click **Delete** adjacent to the target token and confirm by typing **DELETE** to ensure intentional revocation.

</Steps>
