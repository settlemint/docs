Application access tokens let you connect your SettleMint services with other
apps securely. They represent your application, not individual users, and can be
created by both admins and users. They can be used to connect to all or selected
services of an application.

## Create an application access token

Go to your application's dashboard and click on "App access tokens" in the left
navigation.

Click on the "Add an application access token" button. This opens a form where
you can create your application access token.

1. Choose a **name** for your application access token.
2. Select an **expiration date**. You cannot update this later.
3. Select a scope type. There are two types of scope: **All** or **Specific**.
   1. If you selected **All**, you grant access to all services of the
      application. If you add more services to the application later, this
      access token will grant access to these new services as well.
   2. If you selected **Specific**, you can choose which specific services this
      access token will grant access to.
   3. You can also update the scopes of your application access token later.
4. Click **Confirm** to create your application access token.

<Callout type="warning">
  Copy and save your token securely - you won't see it again. Treat it like a
  password and keep it secret.
</Callout>

## Update an application access token

Navigate to the **application** whose token you want to update.

1. Click **App Access Tokens** in the left navigation, you will see a list of
   all application access tokens for this application.
2. Click on **View scopes** of the token you wish to update. This will first
   open a list where you can view the current scopes of the token.
3. Click on **Update** in the bottom right corner to open a form where you can
   update your application access token.
4. Choose the new scopes for your application access token.
5. Click **Confirm** to update your application access token.

## Delete an application access token

If you are worried that an application access token has been compromised, or you
no longer use the integration for which you had generated a particular
application access token, you can delete that application access token.

1. Navigate to the application dashboard whose application access tokens you
   wish to delete.
2. Click **App Access Tokens** in the left navigation.
3. Click **Delete** next to the application access token you want to delete.
4. Type **DELETE** to confirm. The application access token will no longer be
   usable.

## Use an application access token

You can use these application access tokens in three ways depending on what
works for your use case.

- As a header, you can use the header `x-auth-token: TOKEN`.
- As a query parameter using `https://myservice.settlemint.com/?token=TOKEN`
  appended to any URL.
- As the last part of the URL `https://myservice.settlemint.com/TOKEN`.
  - For IPFS nodes build your uri so it becomes
    `https://myservice.settlemint.com/TOKEN/api/v0/...`
  - For Avalanche and Fuji build your uri so they look like
    `https://myservice.settlemint.com/ext/bc/C/rpc/TOKEN`
