## Enterprise Token Creation Process

<Callout type="success" title="Secure Token Generation">
**Enterprise Security**: SettleMint's personal token creation process implements industry-standard security practices with role-based inheritance, audit logging, and organizational controls for production environments.
</Callout>

### Personal Access Token Management

Navigate to your enterprise profile settings to create secure personal access tokens with role-based permissions for individual blockchain service access.

<Steps>

### Access Personal Token Management
Click your **profile picture or avatar** in the upper right corner, then select **Personal access tokens** to access your enterprise token management interface.

### Initialize Token Creation
Click **"Add a personal access token"** to open the secure token configuration form with enterprise security options.

### Configure Token Parameters
- **Token Name**: Assign a descriptive identifier for personal tracking and enterprise audit purposes
- **Expiration Policy**: Set strategic expiration dates based on organizational security policies (non-modifiable after creation)
- **Role Inheritance**: Automatically inherits your organizational role permissions (admin or user)

### Finalize Token Creation
Click **Confirm** to generate your enterprise-grade personal access token with cryptographic security and organizational audit trail integration.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Enterprise Security Protocol">
**Critical**: Immediately copy and securely store your token using enterprise password management systems. This token provides individual user-level access and cannot be retrieved after creation.
</Callout>

## Enterprise Token Revocation

### Security Incident Response

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Incident Response">
**Immediate Action**: For compromised tokens or discontinued integrations, implement immediate revocation to prevent unauthorized access to enterprise blockchain services.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Access Personal Token Management
Navigate to your profile settings and select **Personal access tokens** to view all active authentication tokens.

### Locate Target Token
Review your personal access token list and identify the token requiring revocation for security or operational reasons.

### Execute Secure Deletion
Click **Delete** adjacent to the target token and confirm by typing **DELETE** to ensure intentional revocation with immediate effect.

</Steps>

## Enterprise Integration Methods

<Callout type="success" title="Production-Ready Authentication">

## Enterprise Token Strategy: Application vs Personal Access

### Strategic Decision Framework

<Callout type="info" title="Enterprise Guidance">
**Strategic Recommendation**: Application access tokens are optimal for production systems and automated processes, while personal access tokens excel for individual development workflows and user-specific integrations.
</Callout>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6 mb-6">
  <Card>
    ### Application Access Tokens
    - **Production systems** requiring 24/7 availability
    - **Automated processes** independent of individual users
    - **Service continuity** unaffected by personnel changes
    - **Granular scope control** for enterprise security
    - **System-to-system** authentication patterns
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Personal Access Tokens
    - **Individual development** and testing workflows
    - **User-specific integrations** requiring personal accountability
    - **Role-based access** inheriting organizational permissions
    - **Personal responsibility** for credential management
    - **Simplified authentication** for individual use cases

- **Service Reliability**: Automated systems maintain consistent access regardless of user status
- **Enterprise Security**: Granular scope control enables zero-trust architecture
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced dependency on individual user accounts

**Use Cases**: Production APIs, automated workflows, system integrations, CI/CD pipelines

</Tab>
<Tab value="development" label="Development & Testing">

**Personal Access Tokens Recommended**
- **Individual Accountability**: Personal tokens enable user activity tracking and audit trails
- **Development Flexibility**: Inherit role-based permissions for appropriate access levels
- **Simplified Management**: Self-service token creation reduces administrative overhead
- **Security Alignment**: Automatic permission inheritance ensures compliance with organizational policies

**Use Cases**: Personal development, testing environments, prototype integrations, individual research

</Tab>
<Tab value="hybrid" label="Hybrid Strategy">

**Enterprise Best Practice**
- **Production**: Application access tokens for all automated systems and critical services
- **Development**: Personal access tokens for individual developer workflows and testing
- **Governance**: Clear policies defining when to use each token type
- **Security**: Regular auditing of both token types with organizational oversight

**Benefits**: Optimal security posture with operational flexibility and individual accountability

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="success" title="Enterprise Security">
**Key Consideration**: Personal access tokens are immediately invalidated when users leave the organization, ensuring automatic security cleanup and preventing unauthorized access to enterprise blockchain services.
