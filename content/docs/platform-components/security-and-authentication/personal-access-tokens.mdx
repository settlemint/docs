# Personal Access Tokens

Personal access tokens (or
[Application access tokens](/platfrom-components/application-access-tokens)) let
you connect your SettleMint services with other apps securely. They represent an
individual user, and have the same rights as the user's role in the organization
(admin or user). They can be used to connect to all services that the user has
access to.

## Create a personal access token

In the upper right corner of any page, click your **profile picture or avatar**,
and then click **Personal access tokens**.

Click on the **Add a personal access token** button, this opens a form where you
can create your personal access token.

1. Choose a **name** for your personal access token.
2. Select an **expiration date**. You cannot update this later.
3. Click **Confirm** to create your personal access token.

<Callout type="warning">
  Copy and save your token securely - you won't see it again. Treat it like a
  password and keep it secret.
</Callout>

## Delete a personal access token

If you are worried that your personal access token has been compromised, or you
no longer use the integration for which you had generated a particular personal
access token, you can delete that personal access token.

1. Navigate to the list of your personal access tokens, and find the personal
   access token you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** next to the personal access token.
3. Type **DELETE** to confirm. The personal access token will no longer be
   usable.

## Use a personal access token

You can use these personal access tokens in three ways depending on what works
for your use case.

- As a header, you can use the header `x-auth-token: TOKEN`.
- As a query parameter using `https://myservice.settlemint.com/?token=TOKEN`
  appended to any URL.
- As the last part of the URL `https://myservice.settlemint.com/TOKEN`.
  - For IPFS nodes build your uri so it becomes
    `https://myservice.settlemint.com/TOKEN/api/v0/...`
  - For Avalanche and Fuji build your uri so they look like
    `https://myservice.settlemint.com/ext/bc/C/rpc/TOKEN`

## Using application access tokens vs personal access tokens

For most use cases, you should use application access tokens. Since they are
directly linked to the application, the token continues to work even if the user
leaves the organization. They also provide more granular access control.

Personal access tokens are a simpler way to authenticate, but they are linked to
the user's account. If the user leaves the organization, the token will no
longer work for the services of that organization.
