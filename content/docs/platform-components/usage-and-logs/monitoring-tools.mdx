title: Monitoring tools
---

For all your running services in a blockchain application, a set of monitoring
tools is available to gain insights into the health and performance of those
services.

## Service statuses

The service status indicates whether your service is running well, facing
issues, or needs your attention.

Go to the **service's overview page** or a **service detail page** to view the
status of a particular service (e.g. network, node, smart contract set, etc.).

## Resource usage status & metrics

You can view the resources (memory, vCPU, and disk space) allocated to your
services at any time, and follow up on the current usage. When the current
resource usage is about to reach its limit, you will see a warning with the
recommendation to scale your resource pack to keep the service running.

Go to the **Resource tab** of a **service detail page** to view the resource
usage status and metrics.

## Network and node stats

Live dashboards allow you to follow up on important stats for network and node
monitoring and identify possible bottlenecks.

Go to the **Details tab** of a **network or node detail page** to view the
stats.

## Network and node logs

You can view real-time logs of your networks and nodes for granular insights
into activity related to them. The logs can be used as a troubleshooting tool if
something goes wrong.

Go to the **Logs tab** of a **network or node detail page** to view the logs.
