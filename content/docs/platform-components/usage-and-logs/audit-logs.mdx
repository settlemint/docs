# Audit Logs

Audit logs provide a detailed record of activities in any application deployed
on the SettleMint Blockchain Transformation Platform. These logs provide the
following key benefits:

- Compliance: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and industry
  standards.
- Accountability: Maintain a clear record of actions and changes made by users
  for transparency.
- Troubleshooting: Facilitate the identification and resolution of issues by
  tracking system activity.
- Data integrity: Provide a reliable trail of data access and modifications,
  protecting against data tampering

Audit logs can be accessed from the application menu, on the left.

Four filters are available to find specific entries in the logs:

- Timestamp: select a time range or a day for which you want to get the logs.
- Service: choose the service you want to analyze.
- User: select a user from your application to see their actions.
- Action: filter based on a specific action (e.g. create, delete, pause,...).
