## Support the Linea and Base Networks

![Changelog Image](./assets/support-the-linea-base-network.png)

SettleMint now supports deploying projects to both the **Linea** zkEVM and **Base** OP Stack networks. The Network Manager automatically exposes the new network cards, updated RPC configuration templates, and brand assets so teams can move from exploration to production in minutes.

- **Linea** brings Consensys-backed zkEVM security, deterministic finality, and native MetaMask integrationsâ€”ideal for regulated DeFi products and loyalty experiences that require predictable fees.
- **Base** extends Coinbase's OP Stack infrastructure with deep USDC liquidity, enterprise-grade observability, and seamless fiat onramps for mainstream adoption.

With these additions you can:

1. Create network instances or join existing environments across testing (Linea Sepolia, Base Sepolia) and production mainnets.
2. Use SettleMint wizards to preconfigure RPC endpoints, gas strategies, and contract deployment pipelines aligned with both ecosystems.
3. Combine Base and Linea networks with your existing permissioned or public deployments to build hybrid, cross-chain architectures.
