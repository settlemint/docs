## Simplified Subgraph Deployments

We've significantly simplified the subgraph deployment process. Here's what's
changed:

**Previously:**

- Required deploying a smart contract set
- Required IPFS deployment
- Middleware needed explicit connections to both smart contract set and IPFS
- Subgraphs could only be deployed to middlewares from their connected smart
  contract set

**Now:**

- Deploy middlewares independently without a smart contract set or IPFS required
- Deploy subgraphs from any smart contract set to any middleware within an
  application

**Key Benefits:**

- Simplified architecture: Reduced deployment complexity and dependencies
- Cost efficiency: Reuse graph middlewares across different smart contract sets
- Enhanced flexibility: Freedom to deploy subgraphs from any smart contract set
  to any middleware
