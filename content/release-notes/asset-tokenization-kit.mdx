## Announcing the "Asset tokenization kit", asset tokenization made easy

We’re excited to announce that the **Asset Tokenization Kit** is now publicly
available! This is a ready-to-go, complete solution designed specifically to
help you launch digital asset platforms quickly, securely, and fully compliant
with industry standards. Whether you’re a bank, financial institution, fintech,
startup, or a government-driven innovation team, this kit makes it easy to roll
out blockchain-based financial instruments—including bonds, equities,
stablecoins, funds, deposits, and even native cryptocurrencies.

Our kit removes the complexity typically associated with blockchain
infrastructure. With pre-integrated smart contracts, user-friendly APIs, and
intuitive interfaces already in place, your team can focus more on innovation
and compliance, rather than getting bogged down in technical details.

### Batteries included

At the heart of the kit are customizable smart contract templates based on
Ethereum standards, specifically tailored to real-world financial use cases.
Each asset type supports the full lifecycle from issuance to redemption,
complete with built-in governance and risk controls. Business users can
effortlessly create and manage digital assets using our asset designer and asset
management modules, while developers get full access to source code, powerful
command-line tools, robust SDKs, and versatile APIs (REST), making integrations
seamless whether you’re linking to your existing enterprise systems or building
new front-end applications.

### Compliance first

Compliance isn’t an afterthought—it’s built directly into the platform. Features
such as whitelisting, transaction limits, collateral tracking, and comprehensive
audit logging make it straightforward to meet regulatory requirements, like
those introduced by MiCA. Additionally, real-time dashboards and visual
analytics give you instant insights into asset performance, user activity, and
compliance metrics, simplifying governance and audit processes.

### Make it your own

We’ve also included an intuitive, responsive front-end built with modern web
technologies. It offers two distinct portals:

- The **Issuer Portal**, where you manage asset creation, oversee asset
  lifecycles, and handle user governance. •
- The **User Portal**, designed specifically for investors and participants to
  easily view, trade, and engage with tokenized assets.

And because the entire front-end is fully open-source and modular, your
development team can quickly customize branding, integrate new KYC processes, or
add specialized visualizations—without compromising security or core
architecture.

### Deploy anywhere

Finally, deployments are hassle-free and optimized for both managed cloud
environments and private infrastructure setups, complete with one-click
provisioning and pre-set configurations for development and production
environments. With the Asset Tokenization Kit, you can move from concept to
pilot in days—accelerating front-end development by up to 8x and smart contract
deployment by up to 4x—while retaining complete flexibility to scale, customize,
and adapt as your tokenization strategy grows.
