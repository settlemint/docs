SettleMint is proud to announce the general availability of the Asset
Tokenization Kit, a full-stack, production-ready solution for launching digital
asset platforms with unmatched speed and compliance. Designed for banks, financial
institutions, fintechs, start-ups and government-led innovation projects, the
kit enables rapid deployment of blockchain-based tokenized instruments such as bonds,
equities, stablecoins, funds, deposits, and native cryptocurrencies. With
pre-integrated smart contracts, APIs, and user interfaces, it eliminates
infrastructure complexity and allows teams to shift focus to product innovation
and regulatory alignment.

The kit includes audited, extensible smart contract templates that adhere to
ethereum standards and are tailored for a variety of real-world financial
instruments. Each asset class supports a lifecycle of issuance, transfer,
compliance, and redemption with built-in governance and risk controls. Business
users will be able to create and manage digital assets through the asset
designer and asset management modules, while developers gain access to the source code, CLI tools,
SDKs, and a robust API layer with REST and GraphQL endpoints
for integration with custom front-ends or into enterprise systems.

Compliance and operational visibility are embedded across the architecture. The
platform includes features such as whitelisting, transaction limits, collateral
tracking, and audit logs, ensuring suitability for regulated environments and
easing adherence to evolving legal frameworks such as MiCA. Real-time dashboards
and visual analytics enable monitoring of supply metrics, user activity, and
portfolio performance, supporting transparent governance and internal audit
processes.

It also includes a fully integrated, responsive front-end
interface built with modern web technologies and designed to deliver intuitive
workflows for both administrators and end users. The interface consists of two
main sections: the **issuer portal**, which provides tools for asset creation,
lifecycle management, and user governance, and the **user portal**, which enables
investors or participants to view, transact, and interact with issued tokens.
The front-end codebase is fully open-source and modular, allowing development
teams to easily rebrand, extend UI components, or integrate business-specific
logic and workflows. Whether adjusting the visual identity to match corporate
branding, embedding new forms for KYC, or adding custom data visualizations, the
UI layer is built to support rapid customization without compromising the
platform’s security or architecture.

Deployments are optimized for both managed cloud and private infrastructure with
one-click provisioning and Dev/Prod configuration presets. By significantly
reducing development timelines, up to 8x faster for front-end and 4x faster for
smart contracts, the Asset Tokenization Kit allows institutions to move from idea
to pilot in days, while retaining full flexibility to scale, customize, and
comply as their tokenization strategy evolves.
