We are excited to announce that the AI Genie in Code Studio has been upgraded to
RooCode, a more powerful AI coding assistant. This upgrade brings broader AI
capabilities to our platform, benefiting all users ‚Äì from those new to Code
Studio to advanced developers and enterprise teams. RooCode expands your AI
toolkit with access to multiple AI providers (including Anthropic‚Äôs models Ôøº)
and introduces smarter context management and enterprise-ready integration
options. Here‚Äôs what the RooCode launch means for you:

### A Boost for All Code Studio Users

RooCode makes Code Studio‚Äôs AI assistance more flexible, intelligent, and
user-friendly. Instead of being limited to a single AI model, RooCode lets you
tap into a variety of cutting-edge AI models for code generation and guidance.
In practice, this means faster, more accurate code suggestions and support
across use cases ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre crafting a Solidity smart contract or
debugging an integration. The AI is context-aware, so it can consider more of
your project‚Äôs code and history when helping you, leading to responses that feel
more relevant to what you‚Äôre working on. The interface remains as easy as ever:
simply ask RooCode for help or let it suggest improvements as you code. No
advanced setup needed to start seeing benefits. In short, every SettleMint user
will notice a smarter, more capable AI assistant ready to accelerate your
blockchain development projects.

### Empowering Developers with Advanced AI Options

For developers, RooCode unlocks unprecedented control and choice in your
AI-assisted workflow. You can now seamlessly integrate multiple AI providers and
models into Code Studio. Want to use OpenAI‚Äôs latest GPT model for one task and
switch to Anthropic‚Äôs Claude for another? RooCode makes that possible with a few
clicks, all within the same environment. It supports Model Context Protocol
(MCP) servers, meaning you can harness enhanced AI processing capabilities and
even enable the AI to use external tools or data sources as part of coding
tasks. This translates into smarter code completion, automated documentation,
and more robust debugging assistance. RooCode‚Äôs advanced context management
ensures the AI remembers and utilizes larger portions of your codebase, so it
can handle complex, multi-file projects and long-running sessions without losing
track. Developers can also customize their AI setup: define profiles for
different projects, tweak the AI‚Äôs behavior with custom instructions, or even
choose local AI models for offline use. In short, RooCode isn‚Äôt just an upgrade
‚Äì it‚Äôs a toolkit for power users to supercharge development productivity with
AI.

### Enterprise-Grade Integration and Control

Enterprise clients will especially appreciate that RooCode was built with
security, configurability, and scalability in mind. You have the option to
integrate your own API keys for AI providers or use dedicated enterprise AI
instances, ensuring compliance with internal policies and full control over how
and where your code data is processed. For example, if your organization uses a
private cloud OpenAI endpoint or Anthropic‚Äôs enterprise API, Code Studio can be
configured to route requests through those credentials seamlessly. RooCode‚Äôs
support for local deployments means you can even run AI models on-premises (or
within your VPC) via supported frameworks like Ollama or LM Studio Ôøº Ôøº, keeping
sensitive code completely in-house. The introduction of MCP support allows
enterprises to extend RooCode with custom tools ‚Äì connecting the AI assistant to
internal knowledge bases, databases, or devops pipelines ‚Äì all under your
control. Advanced context management not only improves the developer experience
but also ensures that the AI can function within the boundaries you set (for
instance, respecting project-specific data privacy rules or utilizing extended
context windows for large enterprise codebases). With RooCode, enterprises get a
future-proof AI assistant that adapts to corporate needs: integrate it into your
single sign-on and governance workflows, monitor usage with full transparency,
and scale AI assistance across development teams without compromising on
security or performance.

Ready to experience RooCode‚Äôs capabilities firsthand? It‚Äôs live now in your
SettleMint Code Studio ‚Äì simply log in and start coding to try it out. We
encourage everyone to give RooCode a spin at the SettleMint Console and explore
the rich documentation and guides available on
[the RooCode docs](http://docs.roocode.com) for deeper technical details. This
upgrade is a big step in our mission to empower you with the best tools for
blockchain development. We can‚Äôt wait to see what you build with the Code Studio
as your smart contract development partner. Happy coding! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
