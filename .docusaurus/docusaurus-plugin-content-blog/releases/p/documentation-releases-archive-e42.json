Data Aggregation: APIs can consolidate data from multiple smart contracts, providing a unified view.\n\n3. Improved Performance: GraphQL optimizes data fetching, ensuring that clients retrieve only the necessary data in a single request, reducing network load and improving performance.\n\n4. Stack agnostic: Teams are free to choose their own technology stack.\n\nMore information on [https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/docs/using-platform/middleware/#the-smart-contract-portal-middleware](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/docs/using-platform/middleware/#the-smart-contract-portal-middleware)"},{"id":"/2024/07/10/installation-guide-for-google-cloud-platform","metadata":{"permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/07/10/installation-guide-for-google-cloud-platform","source":"@site/releases/2024-07-10-installation-guide-for-google-cloud-platform.md","title":"Installation guide for Google Cloud Platform","description":"Changelog Image","date":"2024-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.25,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Smart Contract Set Portal","permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/07/23/smart-contract-set-portal"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hashgraph Hedera","permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/06/27/hashgraph-hedera"}},"content":"![Changelog Image](../static/img/releases/installation-guide-for-google-cloud-platform.png)\n\nGetting started with the self-managed platform might seem daunting, but in practice it is not that complex.

It uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which is a unique and novel approach to achieving consensus in a distributed network.\n\nHedera’s native cryptocurrency is called HBAR, and it is used to power the network’s services, including smart contracts, file storage, and regular transactions.\n\nHedera focuses on providing high throughput, low latency, and fair transaction ordering, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications. Unlike blockchain-based systems, Hedera’s Hashgraph algorithm ensures fast, fair, and secure transactions without compromising decentralization. We support, the Hedera Mainnet and the Hedera Testnet.\n\nRead more on [https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/docs/blockchain-guides/Hedera/hedera-the-basics/](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/docs/blockchain-guides/Hedera/hedera-the-basics/)"},{"id":"/2024/04/22/embedded-o11y-infrastructure","metadata":{"permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/04/22/embedded-o11y-infrastructure","source":"@site/releases/2024-04-22-embedded-o11y-infrastructure.md","title":"Embedded o11y infrastructure","description":"Changelog Image","date":"2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.185,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Hashgraph Hedera","permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/06/27/hashgraph-hedera"},"nextItem":{"title":"Managed Platform v7","permalink":"/documentation/releases/2024/04/02/managed-platform-v7"}},"content":"![Changelog Image](../static/img/releases/embedded-o11y-infrastructure.png)\n\nThe platform now includes a complete observability suite.
