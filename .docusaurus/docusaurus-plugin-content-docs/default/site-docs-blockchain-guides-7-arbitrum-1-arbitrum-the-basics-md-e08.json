  "description": "Arbitrum was launched in August 2021 by Offchain Labs, and has its own cryptocurrency since March 2023 called ARB. It is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that focusses on security, scalability and compatibility. Arbitrum uses optimistic rollup technology to process transactions off-chain, which allows it to offer significantly faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum mainnet. It uses AVM (Arbitrum Virtual Machine) which is a custom virtual machine that was created for the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution. The AVM is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), but it also includes a number of optimizations that make it more efficient and scalable. In addition to scalability and compatibility, Arbitrum is also focused on decentralization. The Arbitrum network is secured by a decentralized network of validators, and it is governed by a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). This ensures that Arbitrum is not controlled by any single entity.",
