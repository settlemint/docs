### Fabric nodes under an application now share an mspId

Previously, each Fabric node had a different MSP ID, meaning it belonged to a separate organization in the Fabric network. Now, Fabric nodes under an application use a single MSP ID defined at the application level. So all nodes under an application belong to one organization in the fabric network.

This change is not backwards compatible, so we suggest creating a new network to use future updates.
