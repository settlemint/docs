# Introducing Dev Tools

We've made some exciting changes to improve your development experience:

**What's New**

- We've introduced a new **Dev Tools** section that will host various services aimed at making the development of decentralized applications easier
- The first tool we're launching is **Code Studio** - our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Visual Studio Code
- Smart contract sets are now available as the first type of Code Studio

**What's Changed**

- The "Smart contract sets" section has moved into Dev tools
- Don't worry - all the same great features of Smart contract sets are still there, just in a new home!

**Coming Soon**

Stay tuned for more types of Code Studios that will make building decentralized applications even easier!

---

**Note**: All existing Smart contract sets functionality remains unchanged - we've just reorganized things to make room for more developer tools.
