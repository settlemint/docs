# Hashgraph Hedera

![Changelog Image](../static/img/releases/hashgraph-hedera.png)

Hedera is a public distributed ledger technology (DLT) network that was launched in August 2018 by Hedera Hashgraph, LLC. It uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which is a unique and novel approach to achieving consensus in a distributed network.

Hedera’s native cryptocurrency is called HBAR, and it is used to power the network’s services, including smart contracts, file storage, and regular transactions.

Hedera focuses on providing high throughput, low latency, and fair transaction ordering, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications. Unlike blockchain-based systems, Hedera’s Hashgraph algorithm ensures fast, fair, and secure transactions without compromising decentralization. We support, the Hedera Mainnet and the Hedera Testnet.
